          <h1>Blog Post 1 - The Library of Babel and the Internet</h1>
          <p>By Michael Parkin | 2021 | Theory</p>

        <p>
          In this blog post I reflect on the 1944 work The Library of Babel by
          Jorge Luis Borges. Although this story predates the internet, many
          theorists believe that the library that Borges describes directly
          relates to the internet. To start I go over the story’s main concepts
          and ideas before comparing it to the concepts of the internet, and I
          finish by stating whether I believe the story and its concepts should
          be compared at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Firstly, in its most basic form The Library of Babel presents the
          reader with the idea that there is a vast, almost infinite, library
          that consists of every book ever written. However, this library is
          only infinite because all the books consist of every possible
          permutation of a specific set of letters, and punctuation – whether
          the books make logical sense or not. This is Borges attempt at
          creating an ideal and universal library that consists of all of
          mankind’s knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          This idea of a library that is infinite and consists of all mankind’s
          knowledge is the reason that most theorists compare the library of
          Babel to the internet, and it is important that we compare the extent
          of their infiniteness. While Borges originally states that the library
          is infinite, he later contradicts himself and states that “each book
          contains four hundred ten pages; each page, forty lines; each line,
          approximately eighty black letters.” (Borges & Hurley, 1999, pp. 113)
          This would limit the numbers of books, although to a very large
          number. Compared to the internet, a similar idea can be seen. People
          refer to the internet as infinite, not because it is truly infinite
          but because it is not feasible to account for all of it as it is ever
          growing. While one could argue that the internet is truly infinite and
          continually expanding, I would argue that it is not. If one applied
          the same algorithm from the library of Babel, they would be required
          to include all the different variables that the internet consists of,
          which would result in a number that, while huge, is not infinite.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, one can also make a connection between the library of
          Babel and the internet because of the uniqueness of the information in
          both. The library of Babel consists of unique texts, that potentially
          only differ slight, but are still unique. This can also be seen on the
          internet through webpages and Uniform Resource Locators (URLs).
          Although most webpages that are commonly visited are distinct and
          unique, there are inevitably webpages that are identical in every way.
          However, their URLs would have to differ, even if by just a single
          letter – just like the books in the library of Babel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, one can look at the content of the books in the library of
          Babel. Borges states that “for every rational line or forthright
          statement there are leagues of senseless cacophony, verbal nonsense,
          and incoherency.” (Borges & Hurley, 1999, pp. 114) This proves the
          point that most books in the library contain gibberish and are
          undecipherable, requiring a person to sift through mostly pointless
          information in search of knowledge. The same can be said about the
          internet, not because most information is gibberish but instead
          because users of it have to sift through worthless information, such
          as fake news, in order to find knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          In conclusion, taking into account that this story predates the
          invention of the internet, it is impressive that Borges was able to
          refer to concepts that would only come decades later. As a result, I
          definitely agree with theorists who believe that the library of Babel
          can be compared to the internet, as long as one keeps the date of
          publication in mind.
