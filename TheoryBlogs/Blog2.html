      <h2>Blog Post 2 - The Impact of the Dot Com Bubble on the Web</h2>

      <p>
        The burst of the dot-com bubble resulted in the loss of trillions of
        dollars, but the affect and impact it had on the internet was huge,
        laying the groundwork for the future. In this blog post I discuss this
        by breaking down the internet and World Wide Web before, during, and
        after the dot-com bubble burst.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although the World Wide Web was established by Tim Berners-Lee between
        the late 1980’s and early 1990’s, it was still not easily accessible to
        many people as it required both expensive hardware and a vast technical
        knowledge. However, this all changed when the more user focused
        browsers, Mosaic and Netscape Navigator, launched in 1993 and 1994
        respectively. Along with their more user-friendly design, they allowed
        the internet to be more accessible to the average person as they were
        available on more platforms. This led to an exponential increase in both
        internet users and overall web traffic.
      </p>
      <p>
        This created a shift in entrepreneurs who now saw potential on the
        internet and creating dot-com companies (companies created around
        website ideas). This exponential growth of the internet blindsided
        investors and they quickly invested more money into these companies –
        being told more money invested now would result in higher profits later.
        This resulted in the “stock equity valuations” of technology and the
        internet to grow and led to many dot-com companies IPOs (Initial Public
        Offerings) gaining exponential growth and unheard-of valuations.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the majority of these companies were reporting a loss, focusing
        their efforts and investors’ money on growth – as investors only caried
        about this, along with the websites userbase and valuations. But in the
        early 2000’s things quickly changed when the Japanese economy went into
        a recession. This acted as a catalyst for the dot-com bubble bursting as
        investors quickly became more cautious with their money and the dot-com
        company’s high valuations started to fall. While bigger investors were
        not badly affected, it was the average investor that was impacted the
        most – losing trillions of dollars.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nonetheless, the bursting of the dot-com bubble had its positives.
        First, this proved as a valuable lesson for both future companies and
        investors to take profit into account and not only valuation and growth.
        Secondly, this quick expansion of the internet meant that the
        infrastructure for the internet needed to expand. This resulted in an
        important infrastructure of fiber optics being laid down. On top of
        this, with most of the dot-com companies becoming bankrupt, a large
        amount of bandwidth on this infrastructure became unused. This paved the
        way for future companies to come in and expand both easily and cheaply.
      </p>
      <p>
        So although the bursting of the dot-com bubble resulted in trillions of
        dollars being lost, it was an important milestone in the development of
        the internet as it taught both tech companies to seek more than just
        valuation and growth, and it helped lay the foundation for the future of
        the internet. Although, as much as it may have taught a lesson, many now
        argue that we are currently facing a repeat of what happened during the
        dot-com bubble in the form of the app bubble and a crypto bubble.
