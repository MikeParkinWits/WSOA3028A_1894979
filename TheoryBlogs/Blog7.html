      <h2>Blog Post 7 - The History and Purpose of Web Robots</h2>

      <p>
        When people hear the term web robots, they may think of physical robots
        that access the web, but this is not the case. Instead, web robots are
        just pieces of software that traverse the web, performing various tasks
        such as automation and data indexing. In this blog post I look at web
        robot’s origin and functions, the different forms they come in, and
        their importance on the web.
      </p>

      <p>
        First, we can look at a brief history of web robots/internet bots. The
        idea of web robots is not new with their origin being traced back as far
        as the inception of the world wide web in the late 1980’s. Originally,
        these bots were used for automation purposes, however, since then
        different types of bots have been developed and used in other places
        around the web. In fact, just over half of all web traffic today is
        generated by bots.
      </p>

      <p>
        Furthermore, we can look at the different types of bots used on the web.
        First, there are spider web robots which are used by search engines to
        search and index the web. These allow search engines to provide the user
        with more accurate search results. Next, there are trading web robots
        that are used to traverse the web and find the best deals across
        multiple e-commerce websites. Then there are media web robots, which are
        used to find the most recent news, weather, and various other forms of
        media.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, as with the internet as a whole, not all web robots are good.
        Here we will look at the four main types of malicious web robots on the
        web today. First there are spam web robots, which mainly collect data
        from the web to spread advertisements to users. Next there are hacker
        web robots, which attempt to find vulnerabilities across the web that
        can be exploited. Third, there are botnets, which are networks that
        hackers use to perform various malicious acts such as denial of service
        attacks. Lastly, there are download web robots that forcibly redirect
        users to malicious websites instead of the website the user intends to
        visit.
      </p>

      <p>
        In conclusion, although web robots have been used for a malicious
        intent, ultimately, I believe that the positive impact that they play
        outweighs their potential negatives. In fact, web robots have served an
        important role in shaping the internet, and still continue to do so
        today. Without them, search engines such as Google and Bing would not be
        nearly as useful nor powerful and as a result, the internet to become an
        extremely easy to use, and valuable, tool in our everyday lives.
