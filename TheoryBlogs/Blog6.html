    <h1>Week 5</h1>
    <h2>Blog Post 6 - A Look at Web Robots</h2>

    <p>
        When people hear the term web robots, they may think of physical robots that access the web however, web robots are actually just pieces of software that traverse the web virtually. They perform various tasks, such automated, data indexing, but also have malicious intents too. In this blog post I go over the idea of Web Robots, looking specifically at their origin and function, the different forms they come in, and their importance on the web.    </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        First, we can look at a brief history of web robots/internet bots on the web. Web robots have been traced back as far as 1988, around the same time the world wide web was created by Tim Berners-Lee. In 1988 these bots were used for automation purposes however, since then different types of bots have been developed and used in other places around the web. In fact, just over half of all web traffic today is generated by bots.    </p>
    </p>

        Furthermore, we can then look at the different types of bots that make up half of all web traffic. First, there are spider web robots which are used by search engines to search and index the web. These allow search engines to provide the user with more accurate search results. Next, there are trading web robots that are used to traverse the web and find the best deals across multiple e-commerce websites. Then there are media web robots, which are used to find the most recent news, weather, and various other forms of media. However, as with the internet as a whole, not all are good. There are four main types of malicious web robots: spam web robots, which mainly collect data from the web to spread advertisements to users; hacker web robots, that attempt to find vulnerabilities across the web to exploit; botnets, which are networks that hackers use to perform various malicious acts; and finally download web robots that are used to forcibly redirect users to malicious websites.    </p>       
    </p>
    <p>
        Although web robots have been used for a malicious intent, ultimately I believe that they have served an important role in shaping the internet, and still continue to do so today. Without web robots, search engines such as Google and Bing would not be nearly as useful. This has enabled the world wide web and the internet to become an extremely powerful tool, and as a result they are the reason the web has been able to become an integral part of our everyday lives.    </p>
