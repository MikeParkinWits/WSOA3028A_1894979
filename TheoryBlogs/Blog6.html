    <h1>Week 4</h1>
    <h2>Blog Post 6 - The Importance of Good Semantic Markup</h2>

    <p>
        The Oxford English Dictionary defines the word semantic as “relating to meaning in language or logic” (“Semantic,” n.d.), but how exactly does this relate to web design? In this blog post, I will look at the importance of using semantics, in the form of semantic markup, when writing HTML. To do this I start by defining what semantic markup is, with the aid of examples, before looking at why one should even use semantic markup when writing HTML.
    </p>

    <p>
        First, we can look at what semantic markup is. To use words semantically means to use it in the correct way that relates to its meaning. When writing HTML, there are a number of different tags with different semantic meanings. By extension, semantic markup is then the process of using HTML tags in the way that they were intended to be used, giving meaning to what you write (see figure 1 below). For example, using &lt;h1&gt; tags for headers, or &lt;p&gt; tags for paragraph would be good semantic markup. However, while it is possible to use a &lt;h1&gt; tag for paragraphs, and a &lt;p&gt; tag for headers, this would not be semantic as that is not their intended purpose nor meaning. On top of this, certain HTML tags, such as &lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt;, do not contain any meaning and therefore cannot be used semantically at all.

    <p>
        But why is semantic markup important, and what are the benefits of using it correct? There are actually two distinct benefits of using semantic markup. First, by using semantic markup you will produce better code that is clearer and more concise. This can help you with understand your code better in the event that you need to go back and review old code. Secondly, and most importantly, semantic markup can help your code be more accessible to people with disabilities (using screen readers) and web robots. This is because both screen readers and web robots rely on semantics to relay information about websites.

        In conclusion, by defining semantic markup, I was able to give two important benefits of using correct semantic markup when writing HTML.
