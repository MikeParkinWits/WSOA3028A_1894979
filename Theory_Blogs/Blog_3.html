    <h2>Blog Post 3 - The importance of Web 2.0</h2>
    <article> 
        
        The web has changed drastically since its inception in the late 1980’s, and I would argue that one of its most important changes was the shift from the Web 1.0 to Web 2.0. Here I discuss this shift, its importance, and then briefly look forward into the future of the web and the shift to the Web 3.0.

        <br><br>
        From the world wide web’s inception, and through the entirety of the 1990’s, the web was on version 1.0. Although this was revolutionary at the time, and offered great innovation, it left a lot to be desired for most users. The Web 1.0 consisted mainly of server-side information, and as such the webpages were all static. This meant that users were able to access webpages to gain information, but were unable to add onto the web and create their own content.
        <br><br>
        However, this changed in the 2000’s when the Web 2.0 was introduced. This signalled a shift from static read-only websites, to more interactive read and write websites. With a bigger emphasis on dynamic client-side webpages, not only where users able to gain information from the internet but they were now able to create their own form of content too. This signalled the age of the User-Generated content. Users were now doing everything from leaving reviews for products on e-commerce websites, to creating personal blogs. The paved the way for the social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter; and crowd-contribution sites like Wikipedia. This version of the web was now built around the users and their needs, giving people a voice on the internet.
        <br><br>
        Even though the Web 2.0 helped pave the way for a more user focused internet, it was not all positive. Along with this, the Web 2.0 helped boost a more centralised web where this user-generated content started to become monetised. Big centralised companies such as Google, Facebook, and Amazon were now trying to build an audience in order to collect data. Once enough data was collected this data would be sold to create target advertising – which was never a concern with the Web 1.0.
        <br><br>
        However, thankfully this is currently changing. Currently we are moving into the Web 3.0, which is a version of the Web that is safer and more inclusive as it signals a shift to a more decentralized web. This is brought on through the use of blockchain and allows users to have control over their own data, instead of big centralised companies. But this shift has proven to take time, and as a result some say we are currently in the transitionary stage of the Web 2.5 - a combination of both the Web 2.0 and Web 3.0
        <br><br>
        In conclusion, the Web 2.0 was influential not only because of its technological evolution, but because of its shift to a more user-generated web. However, this version of the web created problems in terms of centralization and user privacy. Luckily though, we are currently in slow a transition period to a new version of the web that is meant to be decentralised and will allow users to take control of their data instead.
