        <p>
          Jake Sky had always stood out from a young age, if not for his height,
          then for his appearance. However, it is as if he had chosen to stand
          out for the last 10, of his 28, years as his appearance looked
          straight out of a modern-day version of Grease. He never left home
          without his trusty leather jacket and always made sure that his dirty
          blonde hair was slicked back, although a few strands always managed to
          fall forward onto his tanned skin as the day progressed. In the off
          chance that you would see Jake without his jacket on, one might notice
          his toned build and faint white tattoo on his left arm. Even though
          his appearance scared many off, those who were not scared off were
          pleasantly surprised once he took off his dark shaded sunglass and
          introduced himself with a charming smile, and dignified Californian
          accent.

          Although originally born in Texas, Jake had moved around more than
          most during his childhood because of his father’s work. As a result,
          Jake became close with his family, and relied on his younger sister
          Kee for emotional support. However, when his father passed away, his
          mother decided to settle down in California so that Jake and Kee could
          have a more stable childhood. When moving to California, Jake came
          across his father’s old polaroid camera and remembered all the fond
          memories they had using it together before he passed. From that day
          on, Jake took the Polaroid everywhere he went and subsequently gained
          the same obsession for photography as his father.

          But for Jake, this was more than just an obsession, and quickly became
          his career, sending him to all corners of the globe. Although he no
          longer kept his father’s Polaroid by his side, it would be a rare
          sight to see him without his beaten-up Canon glued to his hand.
          However, even though Jake had worked endlessly to gain recognition in
          the photography industry, he soon realized that he wanted to do more
          than just photography and explore filmmaking too. Though he had yet to
          successfully break into the film industry, he was willing to do
          anything to achieve his goal.

          This passion led Jake to his final attempt at filmmaking. He knew that
          this would be his last attempt at filmmaking, so he risked it all and,
          along with his two best friends (Casey and Luke), wrote an independent
          film set in Zambia. However, while traveling to film and produce it
          they had a layover in Johannesburg where they had been hit with a new,
          unexpected, roadblock. Because of an outbreak of the coronavirus,
          South Africa had been put into lockdown and they were now stuck in
          Johannesburg indefinitely. Armed with this new problem, Jake and his
          friends decided to do the unthinkable and rewrite the entire film to
          be set in a city they knew nothing about – Johannesburg. While
          researching the city, Jake uses his photography skills to capture the
          city and gain insight for his film.
