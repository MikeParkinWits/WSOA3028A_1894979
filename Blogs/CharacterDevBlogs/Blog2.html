            <p>
              Jake Sky had always stood out from a young age, if not for his
              height, then for his appearance. However, it is as if he had
              chosen to stand out for the last 10, of his 28, years as his
              appearance looked straight out of a modern-day version of Grease.
              He never left home without his trusty leather jacket and always
              made sure that his dirty blonde hair was slicked back, although a
              few strands always managed to fall forward onto his tanned skin as
              the day progressed. In the off chance that you would see Jake
              without his jacket on, one might notice his toned build and faint
              white tattoo on his left arm. Even though his appearance scared
              many off, those who were not scared off were pleasantly surprised
              once he took off his dark shaded sunglass and introduced himself
              with a charming smile, and dignified Californian accent.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although originally born in Texas, Jake had moved around more than
              most during his childhood because of his father’s work. As a
              result, Jake became close with his family, and relied on his
              younger sister Kee for emotional support. However, when his father
              passed away, his mother decided to settle down in California so
              that Jake and Kee could have a more stable childhood. When moving
              to California, Jake came across his father’s old polaroid camera
              and remembered all the fond memories they had using it together
              before he passed. From that day on, Jake took the Polaroid
              everywhere he went and subsequently gained the same obsession for
              photography as his father.

            <p>
              But for Jake, this was more than just an obsession, and quickly
              became his career, sending him to all corners of the globe.
              Although he no longer kept his father’s Polaroid by his side, it
              would be a rare sight to see him without his beaten-up Canon glued
              to his hand. However, even though Jake had worked endlessly to
              gain recognition in the photography industry, he soon realized
              that he wanted to do more than just photography and explore
              filmmaking too. Though he had yet to successfully break into the
              film industry, he was willing to do anything to achieve his goal.
            </p>
            <p>
              This passion led Jake to his final attempt at filmmaking. He knew
              that this would be his last attempt at filmmaking, so he risked it
              all and, along with his two best friends (Casey and Luke), wrote
              an independent film set in Zambia. However, while traveling to
              film and produce it they had a layover in Johannesburg where they
              had been hit with a new, unexpected, roadblock. Because of an
              outbreak of the coronavirus, South Africa had been put into
              lockdown and they were now stuck in Johannesburg indefinitely.
              Armed with this new problem, Jake and his friends decided to do
              the unthinkable and rewrite the entire film to be set in a city
              they knew nothing about – Johannesburg. While researching the
              city, Jake uses his photography skills to capture the city and
              gain insight for his film.
