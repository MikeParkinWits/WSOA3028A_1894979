            <p>
              When thinking of a fictional character to create, I struggled to
              make a decision as I knew the type of character that I needed to
              create would ultimately affect my website design overall. However,
              after multiple different variations I finally landed on the
              fictional character of Jake Sky – a creative freelance
              photographer and videographer. I chose to have a creative
              character because while I was researching different website
              designs, I found myself gravitating more towards creative blogs.
              This was because their visual design and user experience stood out
              among the rest. As a result, I knew a creative character would
              give me the creative freedom to create a website similar to these.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, this is not the only reason I chose to have a creative
              character. Like Jake, I also enjoy photography – albeit not so
              much as to make it my career. So, by creating a photography
              character I would then be able use my own photos to help expand
              the characters creative portfolio on the website, ultimately
              fleshing out their character and making them feel more realistic.
              On top of this, I also have insight into the photography world,
              which will help when creating character blog posts down the line
              that feel more realistic.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although, people may be confused as to why Jake is an American
              visiting Johannesburg, and not just a South African – the reason
              for this is twofold. Firstly, this gives Jake an outsider view
              into South Africa. This allows me to explore Johannesburg from a
              tourist’s perspective, which I believe will create more
              interesting observations and creative blog posts. Secondly, it
              allows me to establish Jake as a ‘researcher’ in South Africa,
              actively going out to try and find both information about, and
              photography/videography spots around, the city. This goes hand in
              hand with what Jake is trying to achieve while in South Africa –
              film a movie.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lastly, it is important to understand why I felt that Jakes
              character would even need a website. As he is a freelancer, it is
              vital that he has a space to showcase his creative portfolio.
              While many creatives only have social media to do this, a website
              can act as a central location to store the best of the
              freelancer’s work, while also acting as a space for people to
              easily contact them for work. As such, this creative portfolio
              will be the focus point of the website as a whole.
