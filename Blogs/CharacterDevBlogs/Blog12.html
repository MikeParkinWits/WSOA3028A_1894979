        <p>
          When thinking of a fictional character to create, I struggled to make
          a decision as I knew the type of character that I needed to create
          would ultimately affect my website design overall. However, after
          multiple different variations I finally landed on the fictional
          character of Jake Sky – a creative freelance photographer and
          videographer. I chose to have a creative character because while I was
          researching different website designs, I found myself gravitating more
          towards creative blogs. This was because their visual design and user
          experience stood out among the rest. As a result, I knew a creative
          character would give me the creative freedom to create a website
          similar to these.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, this is not the only reason I chose to have a creative
          character. Like Jake, I also enjoy photography – albeit not so much as
          to make it my career. So, by creating a photography character I would
          then be able use my own photos to help expand the characters creative
          portfolio on the website, ultimately fleshing out their character and
          making them feel more realistic. On top of this, I also have insight
          into the photography world, which will help when creating character
          blog posts down the line that feel more realistic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although, people may be confused as to why Jake is an American
          visiting Johannesburg, and not just a South African – the reason for
          this is twofold. Firstly, this gives Jake an outsider view into South
          Africa. This allows me to explore Johannesburg from a tourist’s
          perspective, which I believe will create more interesting observations
          and creative blog posts. Secondly, it allows me to establish Jake as a
          ‘researcher’ in South Africa, actively going out to try and find both
          information about, and photography/videography spots around, the city.
          This goes hand in hand with what Jake is trying to achieve while in
          South Africa – film a movie.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, it is important to understand why I felt that Jakes character
          would even need a website. As he is a freelancer, it is vital that he
          has a space to showcase his creative portfolio. While many creatives
          only have social media to do this, a website can act as a central
          location to store the best of the freelancer’s work, while also acting
          as a space for people to easily contact them for work. As such, this
          creative portfolio will be the focus point of the website as a whole.
