        <section class="e-content blog-text">
          <p>
            As I made sure to thoroughly plan out my wireframes from the
            beginning of the project, I have always had a clear idea of both
            what my website should look like and how it would flow. As such, the
            general layout of all my updated wireframes is the same as my
            original ones. However, while not much has changed compared to my
            original wireframes, there have been some changes which I detail
            down below.
          </p>

          <header><h2>Homepage Wireframe</h2></header>
          <figure>
            <img
              src="../../Images/WebDevelopmentImages/New_Wireframes/Homepage.jpg"
              alt="My Homepage Wireframe"
              width="600"
              title="My Homepage Wireframe"
            />
          </figure>

          <p>
            Here we can see that I have made two changes compared to my original
            wireframes. This is most obvious at point 3 with my portfolio card.
            My original card was planned to be one image with text on top of it.
            However, this resulted in a bad user experience as the banner image
            right above was not clickable and looked very similair but the
            portfolio card was. As such, I took inspiration from my blog card,
            creating a new portfolio card. This resulted in a much better user
            experience as the cards function was more more readable, allowing
            for the overall design and flow of the page to be more consistent.
          </p>

          <p>
            On top of this, a more minor change can also be seen at point four,
            where I have added a subtle accented background change. This acts as
            a visual divide for the user so that they understand that the
            portfolio and the blogs are two seperate sections of the website.
          </p>

          <header><h2>Portfolio Selector Wireframe</h2></header>
          <figure>
            <img
              src="../../Images/WebDevelopmentImages/New_Wireframes/Portfolio-Page.jpg"
              alt="My Portfolio Selector Wireframe"
              width="600"
              title="My Portfolio Selector Wireframe"
            />
          </figure>

          <p>
            Following on from this, we can then look at the portfolio selector
            page. Here we can see that it has also adopted the new portfolio
            card design mentioned above. This replaced the alternating portfolio
            card layout from my original design, creating a better user
            experience overall as the new layout of the page is now more
            consistent.
          </p>

          <header><h2>Portfolio Page Wireframe</h2></header>
          <figure>
            <img
              src="../../Images/WebDevelopmentImages/New_Wireframes/Portfolio-Page 1.jpg"
              alt="My Portfolio Page Wireframe"
              width="600"
              title="My Portfolio Page Wireframe"
            />
          </figure>

          <p>
            Furthermore, once the user clicks on a portfolio card they are then
            taken to this screen where they see a gallery of images. I decided
            that this layout did not need to change as it was very simple and
            allowed the user to see the portfolio collection all at once.
          </p>

          <header><h2>Blog Selector Wireframe</h2></header>
          <figure>
            <img
              src="../../Images/WebDevelopmentImages/New_Wireframes/Blog-Page.jpg"
              alt="My Blog Selector Wireframe"
              width="600"
              title="My Blog Selector Wireframe"
            />
          </figure>

          <p>
            Now we can look at the blog selector screen. While fundamentally the
            same as my original wireframes, there are some key differences.
            Firstly, while the blog navigator used to be aligned to the left,
            this appeared unaligned as the heading was centered. As such, I
            decided to center it to to create a sense of consistency.
          </p>

          <p>
            Secondly, I removed the page selector at the bottom of the screen,
            in turn removing the use of multiple pages - opting for one
            continuous page instead. While this means the list of blogs is now
            longer, requiring more scrolling, this makes dynamically loading
            blog cards easier, and allows the user to find older blogs more
            easily.
          </p>

          <header><h2>Blog Page Wireframe</h2></header>
          <figure>
            <img
              src="../../Images/WebDevelopmentImages/New_Wireframes/Blog-Example.jpg"
              alt="My Blog Page Wireframe"
              width="600"
              title="My Blog Page Example"
            />
          </figure>

          <p>
            From this we can start to look at the blog page itself. Compared to
            the original blog page, not much has changed - with the only major
            change being the left alignment of the reference title. This was
            done to created better consistency on the page, as it now lines up
            with the blogs heading. On top of this, I added the same accented
            background colour to the reference list to seperate the blog itself
            from its references. This ultimately helps with the readability of
            the page and the blog.
          </p>

          <header><h2>About Page Wireframe</h2></header>
          <figure>
            <img
              src="../../Images/WebDevelopmentImages/New_Wireframes/About-Page.jpg"
              alt="My About Page Wireframe"
              width="600"
              title="My About Page Wireframe"
            />
          </figure>

          <p>
            Like the blog page, not much has changed with the about page. Here
            the only difference is, again, the accented background colour to
            help seperate Jake's about from his past clients and jobs.
          </p>

          <header><h2>Contact Page Wireframe</h2></header>
          <figure>
            <img
              src="../../Images/WebDevelopmentImages/New_Wireframes/Contact-Page.jpg"
              alt="My Contact Page Wireframe"
              width="600"
              title="My Contact Page Wireframe"
            />
          </figure>

          <p>
            Lastly, there is the contact page. Here, like most other pages, I
            also added an accented background colour. Although, that is not all.
            At point three we can see that comapred to my original wireframes,
            the email field has now changed. Instead of being a field just
            showing the email address, it now looks like the social media cards.
            This was done to further increase the pages' consistency, as the old
            layout looked broken as a result of the email looking different to
            the other social media cards.
