              Websites can be challenging to create, and as such many rely
              heavily on external libraries and frameworks to create them. While
              this may make the creation process easier, it is not always
              necessary – with it being more useful to create your website from
              scratch to allow for better coding practices, a more efficient
              site, and a design that is tailored exactly towards your vision.
              However, there are instances where you need to use external
              dependencies to gain information from other sources. As such, in
              this blog post I will go over the external dependency that I added
              to my website, and why I believe that it is necessary. To start, I
              first look at the considerations that I made when choosing my
              dependency and all the different types of external dependencies
              that I considered. Thereafter, I go over the alternatives to the
              dependency I chose – elaborating on its technical implementation,
              and implications, for my site.
            </p>

            <p>
              To start, it is important to understand the purpose of my
              characters website. Jake Sky is a photographer, and as such he
              mainly uses his website for sharing his photography, with the goal
              of promoting himself. As a result, I knew that the external
              dependency I chose had to revolve around enhancing any visitor’s
              impression of Jake and his photography. With that, I started to
              research various different external dependencies that revolved
              around this idea – which led me to two main external dependencies.
            </p>

            <p>
              Firstly, I considered integrating APIs to display Jakes social
              media accounts on his contact page, instead of just a link to his
              accounts, as this would give visitors a glimpse at his social
              media. To do this, I looked at utilizing the Facebook Graph API,
              Instagram Graph API, and Twitter JavaScript API. However, I chose
              to not do this for two reasons. Firstly, doing this felt redundant
              and unnecessary, as most posts that are on his social media can be
              viewed on the website. Secondly, the exam self-assessment clearly
              states that only one external dependency can be added to the
              project. While I could have implemented a single social media API,
              leaving the other two social media options as links, I decided
              against this as it would have presented a major inconsistency in
              my websites design, which I would not be happy sacrificing.
              Another way I considered addressing this was by removing the links
              to other social media accounts, only keeping the most important.
              However, this would take away from my character as the way Jake
              mainly promotes himself is through all his social media.
            </p>

            <p>
              The second type of dependency I landed on was the idea of using an
              interactive map to display where Jakes portfolio albums were
              photographed. As Jake is meant to have taken photos all around the
              world, I thought that this would be useful to visitors – both to
              get an idea of where Jake has been, and where he took his photos.
              Not only that, but since the map would be interactive people could
              view areas around where the photos were taken – allowing them to
              explore and be inspired to take their own photos. As such, I felt
              that this would be the perfect addition to the website.
            </p>

            <p>
              With that, I then started researching various map APIs in order to
              find one that would be interactive, allow users to easily explore
              areas, feel familiar, and be customizable to fit my websites style
              guide. While I came across multiple different map APIs, I was able
              to narrow my options down to two. First, there is the newest API I
              considered – the Apple Maps MapKit JS API, officially released in
              2018. While I originally believed that the relative newness of the
              API would make it an ideal choice, allowing for an extremely
              robust feature set, it came with one major drawback which I could
              not overcome – it required a paid developer account. As such, I
              was not able to use it. Next, I looked at Google Maps Javascript
              API. As Google Maps is the most popular maps application in the
              world, I was hopeful that it would be a good choice for my website
              – and I was right. It offers an extremely robust feature set and
              allows for expansive customization, which is exactly what I needed
              for my site. Not only that, but because it is the most popular
              maps application in the world, most people are familiar with how
              it works. On top of this, it also offers an immersive street view
              option, which would add to the maps interactivity and allow users
              to more easily view the places where Jake took his photos.
              However, this all came with a slight catch – to use the Maps
              JavaScript API you had to pay. Luckily though, it provided a
              90-day free trial which I utilized for this project.
            </p>

            <p>
              Thereafter, I began implementing the Maps JavaScript API. To
              start, I had to setup an API key, on Google’s Cloud Platform
              website, in order to access the map. While doing this, I also
              restricted the API to only be usable on my website. This was
              important, as all my websites code is freely available on GitHub,
              which means anyone could steal my API and use it for themselves.
            </p>

            <p>
              Furthermore, I then used this API key to create a map on my
              website’s portfolio page. While implementing the map itself was
              not too challenging, because of the extensive documentation, I did
              soon run into an issue when adding the markers on the map.
              Originally, I had planned on populating the map using a KML file
              however, because the exam stipulated that only one external
              dependency could be used, I was unable to do this as KML has to be
              accessed through an external website, which would be an additional
              external dependency. As such, I decided to load the markers
              through JavaScript, with each marker’s location stored in an
              array. This ultimately allowed for a great amount of
              customizability, where I could add custom icons, and information
              windows. These information windows would then be used to give
              visitors a small preview of the portfolio piece when they hover
              over the portfolio marker, informing them that they can click to
              visit the view the entire portfolio. However, this posed a problem
              for my responsive design, as mobile viewers are unable to hover on
              items. As such, I decided to make the information window show up
              on the click of the marker, with the information window providing
              a way to view the entire portfolio (see figure 1 below).
            </p>

              <img
                src="../../Images/WebDevelopmentImages/Blog27-figure1.png"
                alt="An example of my websites map implementation"
                width="350"
                height="216"
                title="An example of my maps markes and information window"
              />

              <figcaption>
                Figure 1: Example of my maps custom markers and information
                window
              </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
              Next, it quickly became apparent that the standard Google Maps
              default style was extremely different from my entire websites
              style guide, and thus it could be jarring to viewers. As such, I
              used Google Maps’ extensive customization features to alter the
              appearance of the map to better suit the greyscale style guide –
              all while keeping contrast in mind for accessible, and the style
              as recognizable as possible.
            </p>

            <p>
              Lastly, I realized that map markers within a close proximity to
              one another are not easily visible when zoomed out, as they
              overlap. While I see this as a major issue, I was unable to fix
              this, as the native solution requires the use of Googles external
              V3 Utility Library – and as we were only allowed to use one
              external dependency, implementing this was not possible. Although
              I did try to code this myself, using nested for loops to compare
              the distance between points and the maps current zoom level, this
              proved to be too complex for me and as such I was unable to find
              an adequate, and effective, solution in time. However, with the
              addition of one extra external dependency this would be an easy
              fix – as it only requires the use of the Marker Clusterer function
              from the V3 Utility Library.
