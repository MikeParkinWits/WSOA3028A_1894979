              Websites can be challenging to create, and as such many rely
              heavily on external libraries and frameworks when creating them.
              While this may make the creation process easier, it is not always
              necessary – with it being more useful to create your website from
              scratch to allow for better coding practices, a more efficient
              load time, and a website design that is tailored exactly towards
              your vision. However, there are instances where you need to use
              external dependencies to gain information from other sources. As
              such, in this blog post I will go over the external dependency
              that I added to my website, and why I believe that it is
              necessary. To start, I first look at the considerations that I
              made when choosing my dependency and all the different types of
              external dependencies that I considered. Thereafter, I go over the
              alternatives to the dependency I chose - elaborating on its
              technical implementation and implications for my site.
            </p>

            <p>
              To start, it is important to understand the purpose of my
              characters website. Jake Sky is a photographer, and as such he
              mainly uses his website for sharing his photography, with the goal
              of promoting himself. As a result, I knew that the external
              dependency had to revolve around Jake and his photography –
              enhancing any visitor’s impression of Jake, and his photography.
              With that, I started to research various different external
              dependencies that revolved around this idea – which led me to two
              major dependencies.
            </p>

            <p>
              Firstly, I considered integrating APIs to display Jakes social
              media accounts on his contact page, instead of just a link his
              accounts, as this would give visitors a glimpse at his social
              media. To do this, I looked at utilizing the Facebook Graph API,
              Instagram Graph API, and Twitter JavaScript API. However, I chose
              not to do this for the two reasons. Firstly, doing this felt
              redundant and unnecessary as most posts that are posted on his
              social medias can be viewed on the website. Secondly, the exam
              self-assessment clearly states that only one external dependency
              can be added to the project. While I could have implemented a
              single social media API, this would leave the other two social
              media options as links – although this presented a major
              inconsistency in my websites design, which I would not be happy
              with sacrificing. Another way I considered addressing this was by
              removing the links to other social medias, and just keeping the
              most important. However, this would take away from my character as
              the way Jake mainly promotes himself is through all his social
              medias.
            </p>

            <p>
              Secondly, I landed on the idea of using an interactive map to
              display where Jakes portfolio albums were photographed. As Jake is
              meant to have taken photos all around the world, I thought that
              this would be useful to visitor – both get an idea where Jake has
              been in the world, and where he took his photos. Not only that,
              but since the map would be interactive people could view areas
              around where the photos are located – allowing them to explore and
              be inspired to take their own photos. As such, I felt that this
              would be the perfect addition to the website.
            </p>

            <p>
              With that, I then started researching various different map APIs
              in order to find one that would be interactive, allow users to
              easily explore areas, be familiar, and be customizable to fit my
              websites style guide. With these ideas in mind, I came across
              multiple different map APIs but narrowed my options down to two.
              First, there is the newest API I considered – the Apple Maps
              MapKit JS API, officially released in 2018. While I originally
              believed that the relative newness of the API would make it an
              ideal choice, and its feature set was extremely robust and
              efficient, it came with one major drawback which I could not
              overcome – it required a paid developer account. As such, I was
              not able to use it. Next, I looked at Google Maps Javascript API.
              As Google Maps is the most popular maps application in the world,
              I was hopeful that it would be a good choice for my website – and
              I was right. It offers an extremely robust feature set and allows
              for expansive customization, which is exactly what I needed for my
              site. Not only that, but because it is the most popular maps
              application in the world, most people are familiar with how it
              works. On top of this, it also offers an immersive street view
              option, which would add to the maps interactivity and allow users
              to more easily view the places Jake takes photos. However, this
              all came with a catch – to use the Maps JavaScript API you had to
              pay. Luckily though, it provides a 90-day free trial which I
              decided to take advantage of.
            </p>

            <p>
              Thereafter, I began implementing the Maps JavaScript API. While
              implementing the map itself was not too challenging, because of
              the extensive documentation, I soon ran into an issue when adding
              the markers on the map. Originally, I had planned on populating
              the map using KML layers. However, because the exam stipulated
              that only one external dependency could be used, I was unable to –
              since KML has to be accessed through an external website, which
              would be an additional external dependency. As such, I decided to
              load the markers through JavaScript, which each marker’s location
              stored in an array. This ultimately allowed for a great amount of
              customizability, where I could add custom icons, and information
              windows. These information windows would then be used to give
              visitors a small preview of the portfolio piece when they hover
              over the portfolio marker, informing them that they can click to
              visit the view the entire portfolio. However, this posed a problem
              for my responsive design as mobile viewers are unable to hover on
              items. As such, I decided to make the information window show up
              on a click of the marker, with the information window providing a
              way to view the entire portfolio.
            </p>

            <p>
              Next, I realized that the standard map style was extremely
              different from my entire websites style guide. As such, I used
              Google Maps extensive customization features to alter the
              appearance of the map to better suit the greyscale style guide,
              while still being as accessible and recognizable as possible.
            </p>

            <p>
              Lastly, I realized that grouped map markers are not visible when
              zoomed out. While I see this as a major issue, I was unable to fix
              this as the native solution requires the use of Googles external
              V3 Utility Library – and as we were only allowed to use one
              external dependency, I was unable to implement this. Although I
              did try to code this myself, using nested for loops to compare the
              distance between points and the maps current zoom level, this
              proved to be too complex for me and I was unable to find an
              adequate, and effective, solution in time. However, with the
              addition of one extra external dependency this would be an easy
              fix – as it only requires the use of the Marker Clusterer Plus
              function from the utility package.
