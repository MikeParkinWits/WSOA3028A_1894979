          </figure>

          <p>
            Above we can see the styleguide created for my website. Although it
            may look very plain (as it only uses shades of black, white, and
            grey), this was a very deliberate choice. Jake Sky is meant to be a
            minimalist, so choosing a very simple colour palette helps to
            convery his personality in the website style itself. On top of this,
            this simple colour palette allows any content to stand out easily.
            As Jake Sky uses his website to display his photography, this
            becomes extremely important as it allows his photography to be the
            main focus of the site, alleviating any distractions.
          </p>

          <p>
            Furthermore, the font type of Helvetica was also chosen to help add
            to the minimalistic nature of the website as it is simple, and
            extremely readable. Next, when looking at the headings, although the
            image does not show the exact sizes (as that would make the image
            extremely large), it does give an indication of the different
            heading sizes relative to one another.
          </p>

          <p>
            Next, we can look at both the buttons and the navigation bar - where
            we again see the common theme of minimalism and simplicity. But
            because of this simplicity it may be difficult to tell when an
            element can be clicked. In order to show this, I make sure that
            every element has a form of feedback so that the user knows that it
            is clickable. When a navigation item is highlighted it changes to a
            slight grey, and when a button is selected its colours invert and a
            slight drop shadow is added. This drop shadow also extends to show
            if any cards on the page are currently selected and clickable.
          </p>

          <p>
            Lastly we can see the Jake Sky logo - which follows the same design
            patterns as the website. Not only this, the logo is also
            responsive/scalable and has two different sizes. The main size can
            be seen on the left however, there are instances where a smaller,
            more condensed, version of the logo is needed. In my case, I have
            used the smaller logo to display a favicon on the browser tab. This
            helps to make the website easy to find if the user has a lot of tabs
            open.
