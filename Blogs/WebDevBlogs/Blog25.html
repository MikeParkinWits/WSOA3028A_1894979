              While I have not made any changes to my websites design since I
              last updated my wireframes, I did make the site more responsive.
              As such, this required that I re-evaluate how my website would
              function on a mobile device.
            </p>

            <p>
              One universal change that was made throughout, to accommodate
              mobile users, was changing the navigation bar at the top from a
              row of buttons, to a hamburger menu. When pressed, the menu will
              then display the same navigation options vertically. This was done
              to account for both mobile device screen sizes, and the touch
              screens that they use. As a result, these vertical buttons now
              account for a bigger touch range as the user would need to use
              their finger, as opposed to a precise mouse.
            </p>

            <h2>Homepage Wireframe</h2>
            <figure>
              <img
                src="../../Images/WebDevelopmentImages/MobileWireframes/Homepage.png"
                alt="My Homepage Wireframe"
                width="600"
                title="My Homepage Wireframe"
              />
            </figure>

            <p>
              On my homepage, we can see that the layout is fairly similar to
              the desktop version of the site however, there are two major
              changes. Firstly, all the content cards are now stacked
              vertically, as opposed to horizontally. This is to allow the
              content to fit more easily in a mobile devices form factor.
              Secondly, when in this mobile view I adjusted the portfolio card
              to have the text underneath the image. This was done to allow the
              portfolio card to better fit a smaller width, while still showing
              a preview of the portfolio item the user would see when clicking
              the card.
            </p>

            <h2>Portfolio Selector Wireframe</h2>
            <figure>
              <img
                src="../../Images/WebDevelopmentImages/MobileWireframes/Portfolio-Page.png"
                alt="My Portfolio Selector Wireframe"
                width="600"
                title="My Portfolio Selector Wireframe"
              />
            </figure>

            <p>
              Next, there is the portfolio selector page. While nothing major
              changes on this page compared to the , we can see the same changes
              from the homepage carry through to this page.
            </p>

            <h2>Portfolio Page Wireframe</h2>
            <figure>
              <img
                src="../../Images/WebDevelopmentImages/MobileWireframes/Portfolio-Page 1.png"
                alt="My Portfolio Page Wireframe"
                width="600"
                title="My Portfolio Page Wireframe"
              />
            </figure>

            <p>
              On the portfolio page itself, I have adjusted the size of the
              images in the gallery. As a mobile device screen is much thinner
              that that of a desktop or tablet, the photos have to be displayed
              in a single item grid. This allows the images to still easily be
              viewable when on a mobile device.
            </p>

            <h2>Blog Selector Wireframe</h2>
            <figure>
              <img
                src="../../Images/WebDevelopmentImages/MobileWireframes/Blog-Page.png"
                alt="My Blog Selector Wireframe"
                width="600"
                title="My Blog Selector Wireframe"
              />
            </figure>

            <p>
              Similar to the homepage, and the portfolio selector page, I made
              the blog cards appear in a vertical column, as opposed to rows, to
              better accommodate the thinner mobile screen size. However, one
              major change here is how the blog category buttons look. Like the
              navigation bar buttons, they needed to be easier to use with touch
              input, and needed to accommodate the smaller screen. Unlike the
              navigation bar, however, I opted to not hide them behind a
              hamburger menu as this felt both unintuitive, and more unnecessary
              work for the user.
            </p>

            <h2>Blog Page Wireframe</h2>
            <figure>
              <img
                src="../../Images/WebDevelopmentImages/MobileWireframes/Blog-Example.png"
                alt="My Blog Page Wireframe"
                width="600"
                title="My Blog Page Example"
              />
            </figure>

            <p>
              When looking at the blog page, we can see that nothing has
              actually changed when compared to the desktop view.
            </p>

            <h2>About Page Wireframe</h2>
            <figure>
              <img
                src="../../Images/WebDevelopmentImages/MobileWireframes/About-Page.png"
                alt="My About Page Wireframe"
                width="600"
                title="My About Page Wireframe"
              />
            </figure>

            <p>
              From the above, we can see that the about page needed to be
              adjusted quite a bit to accommodate for a smaller, thinner, screen
              size. In both my character introduction, and previous work,
              sections I had taken advantage of the desktop space to place
              images and text side-by-side. However, this does not work in a
              mobile view. As such, I moved all of the text below the images.
              This allows for a much better experience on a mobile device.
            </p>

            <h2>Contact Page Wireframe</h2>
            <figure>
              <img
                src="../../Images/WebDevelopmentImages/MobileWireframes/Contact-Page.png"
                alt="My Contact Page Wireframe"
                width="600"
                title="My Contact Page Wireframe"
              />
            </figure>

            <p>
              Lastly, there is the contact page. Here it can be seen that I
              changed the layout of the contact cards from a two column grid, to
              a single vertical row. On top of this, I also decided to centre
              the items as this was more visually appealing when in this single
              column view.
