          <p>
            Welcome to my first official blog post about, I’m glad you’re still
            here! But now, you’ve waited long enough – what’s been going on?
            Like I said in my last post, I’ve been trying to make a movie! But
            you’re probably thinking to yourself, “Jake, you’re only trying?
            It’s been so long!”. I know, I know – but hear me out. I think
            everyone can agree that the last year has been more than crazy, but
            I’ve been pushing through and I think progress is actually starting
            to be made with my movie. That brings me to the topic of today, what
            exactly happened to me that stopped everything in its tracks? Well,
            let me start at the beginning.
          </p>
          <p>
            My close friends Casey and Luke approached me mid-way through 2019,
            ecstatic about this new movie idea that they’re started writing. Now
            not many of you know this, but this wouldn’t be my first run-in with
            directing a movie – with the first few directing attempts going less
            than ideally… So, when Casey and Luke approached me and told me that
            they wanted me on board to direct, I knew this was my chance for
            redemption. However, Casey and Luke are big dreams, and their crazy
            idea was to have it set in Zambia, Africa! But it could have been in
            Antarctica for all I cared, because I was in it for one reason only
            – to prove myself.
          </p>
          <p>
            We start planning straight away, and everything is going as smoothly
            as possible and within months we’re ready to start filming. With our
            flights booked, all of us are feeling ecstatic about the project. We
            hope in the plane, and slowly our dreams are becoming a reality
            however, soon that excitement wore off. Upon landing at our layover
            in Johannesburg, South Africa, we were greeted with devastating news
            – the country had gone into a national lockdown because of the
            Coronavirus, and we were now stuck.
          </p>

          <p>
            But that’s where I’ll leave it for today. I know it’s a bit of a
            cliff hanger, but we do want you coming back for the next one!
          </p>

          <p>
            Until next time - Stay Motivated, Stay Inspired, and Never Stop
            Creating.
