            <p>
              Alright, welcome back to the sixth installment of my (almost)
              bi-monthly blog! Firstly, I’d like to thank you all for sticking
              around this long – it means a lot to me and the crew! And if you
              stick around just a bit longer, we’ll have some exciting news to
              share about the movie really soon! But enough of that, let’s get
              back to why you’re here…
            </p>
            <p>
              So, last time you checked in we’d almost found all our filming
              spots in Johannesburg. However, I said there was one left… For the
              astute of you, I’m sure you’ve realized that I was talking about
              the end location! Now, I’m going to try and keep things as vague
              as possible, so I don’t spoil the movie before it’s even released,
              but keep in mind there will be minor spoilers ahead.
            </p>
            <p>
              So, by now Casey, Luke, and I had searched all around Johannesburg
              and its surrounding areas (as much as we could during the
              lockdown), and we were struggling to find a good location for the
              end scene. Most things were either closed, or not right. However,
              we had gotten this far so we were not going to give up so easily.
              We’d almost crossed off all the spots on the list, but then our
              kind Airbnb hosts told us about a little spot named Maboneng in
              Johannesburg’s CBD. Now, they warned us that the CBD could be a
              little dangerous in places, but we were excited to go check it out
              nonetheless. However, just to be safe we unpacked our expensive
              camera equipment from the car and headed out – using our phones to
              take some test shots.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although we were all a bit on edge, once we started walking around
              the feeling of nervousness turned into intrigue. There was so much
              going on in the CBD, and it felt extremely lively. After a few
              minutes trying to find our way, we then reached Maboneng – this
              neighborhood that Casey describes as South Africa’s version of
              Williamsburg in Brooklyn. Although a lot of restaurants were
              closed because of the lockdown, it was still full of energy. In
              fact, we found a local bar where the owner invited us in with open
              arms and it just felt right – we knew this is where we wanted to
              hold the end of the film. We all spoke about in briefly and asked
              the owner on the spot – and to our surprise he said yes!
            </p>
            <p>
              So, with that, we officially had all our shooting locations in the
              books! We had now finished phase one of our crazy plan, but now
              onto phase 2… The actual filming. But I’ll leave that for the next
              blog.
            </p>
            <p>
              Until next time - Stay Motivated, Stay Inspired, and Never Stop
              Creating.
