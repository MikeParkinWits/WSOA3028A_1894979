            <p>
              Hey everyone, this isn’t part of my usual blog but it’s a quick
              announcement – and I’m really excited about it! Well, sort of…
            </p>
            <p>
              You see, in my last blog post I said I’d be sharing some news
              about my movie really soon, and while it’s not how I planned on
              this going… I am happy to announce that my new movie, Quarter to
              Midnight, is release on Saturday the 31st of July! Quarter to
              Midnight is an action film set in the heart of South Africa –
              Johannesburg. Follow the protagonist, Detective Dlamini as he
              searches for his long-lost brother across the city. But
              unfortunately for him, nothing is quite what it seems, and he
              comes across a few odd cases along the way…
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, you’re probably wondering where you can watch the film? Well,
              if you’re living in Johannesburg, I’ll be premiering it at
              Bioscope Independent Cinema at 44 Stanley! And for all you
              international readers, which I’m sure most of you are, it’ll be
              releasing the very next day on the streaming site IndieFlix -
              globally!
            </p>
            <p>
              Now I said that this was not how I planned on this going, and
              that’s because I originally had hoped to release the film this
              coming weekend, the 3rd of July, but because of a Level 4 Lockdown
              in South Africa the crew have decided to postpone the movie
              release till the end of the month. I apologize for this, but
              unfortunately it was out of our hands…
            </p>
            <p>
              So, that was just a quick update on my movie – and the crew and I
              can’t wait for you all to see it! See you soon for your regularly
              scheduled blog posts!
            </p>
            <p>
              Until next time - Stay Motivated, Stay Inspired, and Never Stop
              Creating.
