              So, I’ve been gone for a while… Actually, for more than a while! A
              lot has happened since my last post on social media in 2019 and
              the world went into chaos, but this hasn’t stopped me from pushing
              forward. I’ve learnt, and experienced a lot, since 2019, and
              you’ve probably been wondering where I’ve been all this time.
              Well, I’m finally able to share that information with all of you –
              I’ve started making a movie! But that probably leaves you
              wondering, why did it take me this long to announce that I’m just
              starting? Well, the world got in the way and roadblocks happened.
              But if you’ve been following me for long enough, you’ll know that
              I’m pretty heavy headed and once I set my mind on something, I’ll
              do everything I can to achieve that goal.
            </p>
            <p>
              So, I don’t have much more to share with you right now, since
              production has been halted quite heavily, but I do have one more
              thing to tell all of you. Starting today, I will be blogging more
              regularly to give you a behind the scenes look at my new venture
              into filmmaking. So, look out for that to get insight into the
              crazy story that my filmmaking carrier turned into.
            </p>
            <p>
              Until next time - Stay Motivated, Stay Inspired, and Never Stop
              Creating.
