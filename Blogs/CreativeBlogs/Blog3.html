          <p>
            So, I’ve been gone for a while… Actually, for more than a while! A
            lot has happened since my last post on social media in 2019 and the
            world went into chaos, but this hasn’t stopped me from pushing
            forward. I’ve learnt, and experienced a lot, since 2019, and you’ve
            probably been wondering where I’ve been all this time. Well, I’m
            finally able to share that information with all of you – I’ve
            started making a movie! But that probably leaves you wondering, why
            did it take me this long to announce that I’m just starting? Well,
            the world got in the way and roadblocks happened. But if you’ve been
            following me for long enough, you’ll know that I’m pretty heavy
            headed and once I set my mind on something, I’ll do everything I can
            to achieve that goal.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, I don’t have much more to share with you right now, since
            production has been halted quite heavily, but I do have one more
            thing to tell all of you. Starting today, I will be blogging more
            regularly to give you a behind the scenes look at my new venture
            into filmmaking. So, look out for that to get insight into the crazy
            story that my filmmaking carrier turned into.
          </p>
          <p>
            Until next time - Stay Motivated, Stay Inspired, and Never Stop
            Creating.
