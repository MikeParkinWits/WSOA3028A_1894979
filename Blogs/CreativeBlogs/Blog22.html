            <p>
              With our first location now found, NIROX Sculpture Park, we all
              started to have the realization that maybe our crazy idea would
              work after all. So, after a successful first day of location
              scouting, we all headed back to the Airbnb and celebrated –
              although we would have preferred a restaurant, but that was still
              a thing of the past at the time.
            </p>
            <p>
              The next day we woke up bright and early – excited to find our
              next location. Unlike in my last blog, this time I won’t go into
              as much detail about each location so that I don’t spoil the
              entire plot of the movie! Instead, I’ll tell you broadly about the
              areas we explored. Next, we needed to find where most of our movie
              would be set. To do this, we explored some more areas around the
              city. While this was a bit challenging, because of the lockdown
              restrictions, we still managed to get an idea of where we wanted
              things to happen.
            </p>
            <p>
              This part took a couple weeks, and we ended up exploring so many
              different areas – Germiston, Edenvale, and Braamfontein just to
              name a few – but on the final day, when we were getting a bit worn
              out, we explored two areas where we knew we wanted the film to be
              based: Sandton and Rosebank. Both were a mix of shopping malls
              (with both apparently holding some of the most popular ones in the
              country), business towers, and residential. These felt perfect to
              us as they were modern, had lots of different locations that could
              be used, and best of all is that they were quite close to our
              Airbnb so we could easily move between the two – allowing us to
              optimize our time while filming.
            </p>
            <p>
              So now we could now check off our opening scene, and most of the
              other scenes in the movie however, there was still one more
              location we needed to find… But I’ll keep that for next time.
            </p>

              Until next time - Stay Motivated, Stay Inspired, and Never Stop
              Creating.
