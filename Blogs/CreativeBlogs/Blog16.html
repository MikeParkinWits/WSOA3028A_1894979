            <p>
              Welcome to my first official blog post about, I’m glad you’re
              still here! But now, you’ve waited long enough – what’s been going
              on? Like I said in my last post, I’ve been trying to make a movie!
              But you’re probably thinking to yourself, “Jake, you’re only
              trying? It’s been so long!”. I know, I know – but hear me out. I
              think everyone can agree that the last year has been more than
              crazy, but I’ve been pushing through and I think progress is
              actually starting to be made with my movie. That brings me to the
              topic of today, what exactly happened to me that stopped
              everything in its tracks? Well, let me start at the beginning.
            </p>
            <p>
              My close friends Casey and Luke approached me mid-way through
              2019, ecstatic about this new movie idea that they had started
              writing. Now not many of you know this, but this wouldn’t be my
              first run-in with directing a movie – with the first few directing
              attempts going less than ideally… So, when Casey and Luke
              approached me and told me that they wanted me on board to direct,
              I knew this was my chance for redemption. However, Casey and Luke
              have big dreams, and their crazy idea was to have it set in Zambia
              - Africa! But it could have been in Antarctica for all I cared,
              because I was in it for one reason only – to prove myself.
            </p>
            <p>
              We start planning straight away, and everything was going as
              smoothly as possible and within months we’re ready to start
              filming. With our flights booked, all of us are feeling ecstatic
              about the project. We hope on the plane, and slowly our dreams are
              becoming a reality - but soon that excitement wore off. Upon
              landing at our layover in Johannesburg, South Africa, we were
              greeted with devastating news – the country had gone into a
              national lockdown because of the Coronavirus pandemic, and we were
              now stuck.
            </p>

            <p>
              But that’s where I’ll leave it for today. I know it’s a bit of a
              cliff hanger, but we do want you coming back for the next one!
            </p>

            <p>
              Until next time - Stay Motivated, Stay Inspired, and Never Stop
              Creating.
