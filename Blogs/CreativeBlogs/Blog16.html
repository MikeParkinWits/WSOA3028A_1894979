            <p>
              So, where did we end off? Ah yes, we had just gotten the terrible
              news that we were now stuck in our layover city of Johannesburg,
              South Africa. At the time, I don’t know what we were more scared
              of – being stuck in a foreign country with no plans, the
              coronavirus outbreak, or the fact that our dreams of filming a
              movie in Zambia now seemed impossible. Realistically, it was most
              likely a combination of all three…
            </p>
            <p>
              We searched for any way to get to Zambia, but that seemed null and
              void at that point. So, with reality now setting in, the only
              thing we could do was look for accommodation. Lucky for us we
              managed to book an Airbnb where the owners let us stay for the
              duration of the lockdown, even though all forms of accommodation
              were officially closed soon after we arrived. We spent a few days
              moping around, thinking that our dream of making this movie had
              gone down the drain, but then I had a revelation. What if we
              filmed the entire movie in South Africa as opposed to Zambia? I
              ran the idea past the others, and while we agreed the situation
              wasn’t ideal, we knew that it was our only chance of getting this
              movie made. Besides, we were stuck in a small Airbnb for, at that
              point, an unknown period – we had nothing better to do than try
              and rewrite the script for South Africa.
            </p>
            <p>
              So, we got to work and soon realized that not all was lost and
              that what we were trying to pull off might just work.
              Unfortunately, while we were able to do a lot of research about
              places to film, it was challenging to get an idea of the place
              since we couldn’t actually visit there. But, soon enough, the
              lockdown started to ease down a bit more, and that’s when things
              really got started…
            </p>

            <p>
              But that’s where I’ll leave it for now – so come back soon to hear
              more about our adventures and roadblocks along the way!
