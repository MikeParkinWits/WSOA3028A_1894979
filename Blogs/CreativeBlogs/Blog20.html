            <p>
              Welcome back! So, last time we ended off with lockdown
              restrictions easing up in South Africa, allowing us to finally
              leave the Airbnb a bit more often. We took this opportunity with
              both hands, as we didn’t know how long this would last, and we
              thought it would be best to start visiting the different places we
              noted on our list. Unfortunately, we quickly learnt that while we
              were allowed out more easily now, a lot of the locations we wanted
              to visit were still closed… But not all!
            </p>
            <p>
              Out of the list of places open to the public, it just so happened
              that one of the potential locations for our opening shot was
              allowed to continue operations (as it was extremely Covid friendly
              and outdoors). It was a sculpture park, in this place Krugersdorp,
              called NIROX. But there was one problem… Because things were still
              officially in lockdown, we couldn’t rent a car – and all the Ubers
              seemed to be restricted too… Luckily for us, our gracious Airbnb
              hosts – who, if you remember, let us stay even though they were
              not officially allowed to be open – had a spare car which they let
              us use. So, off we went to NIROX Sculpture Park.
            </p>
            <p>
              So, with our first location found, we all started to feel better
              about how this new film would turn out – and we were excited to
              keep looking at locations around the city. But that’s for another
              day… But if you want to visualize what I’ve been talking about,
              why not check out my portfolio page where I’ve uploaded some
              photos of the park?
            </p>

              Until next time - Stay Motivated, Stay Inspired, and Never Stop
              Creating.
