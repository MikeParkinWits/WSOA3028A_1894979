          The web has changed drastically since its inception in the late
          1980’s, and I would argue that one of its most important changes was
          the shift from the Web 1.0 to Web 2.0. Here I discuss this shift, its
          importance, and then briefly look forward into the future of the web
          and the shift to the Web 3.0.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the world wide web’s inception, and through the entirety of the
          1990’s, the web was on version 1.0. Although this was revolutionary at
          the time, and offered great innovation, it left a lot to be desired
          for most users. The Web 1.0 consisted mainly of server-side
          information, and as such the webpages were all static. This meant that
          users were able to access webpages to gain information, but were
          unable to add onto the web and create their own content.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, this changed in the 2000’s when the Web 2.0 was introduced.
          This signalled a shift from static read-only websites, to more
          interactive read and write websites. With a bigger emphasis on dynamic
          client-side webpages, not only where users able to gain information
          from the internet but they were now able to create their own form of
          content too. This signalled the age of the User-Generated content.
          Users were now doing everything from leaving reviews for products on
          e-commerce websites, to creating personal blogs. The paved the way for
          the social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter; and
          crowd-contribution sites like Wikipedia. This version of the web was
          now built around the users and their needs, giving people a voice on
          the internet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even though the Web 2.0 helped pave the way for a more user focused
          internet, it was not all positive. Along with this, the Web 2.0 helped
          boost a more centralised web where this user-generated content started
          to become monetised. Big centralised companies such as Google,
          Facebook, and Amazon were now trying to build an audience in order to
          collect data. Once enough data was collected this data would be sold
          to create target advertising – which was never a concern with the Web
          1.0.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, thankfully this is currently changing. Currently we are
          moving into the Web 3.0, which is a version of the Web that is safer
          and more inclusive as it signals a shift to a more decentralized web.
          This is brought on through the use of blockchain and allows users to
          have control over their own data, instead of big centralised
          companies. But this shift has proven to take time, and as a result
          some say we are currently in the transitionary stage of the Web 2.5 -
          a combination of both the Web 2.0 and Web 3.0
        </p>
        <p>
          In conclusion, the Web 2.0 was influential not only because of its
          technological evolution, but because of its shift to a more
          user-generated web. However, this version of the web created problems
          in terms of centralization and user privacy. Luckily though, we are
          currently in slow a transition period to a new version of the web that
          is meant to be decentralised and will allow users to take control of
          their data instead.
