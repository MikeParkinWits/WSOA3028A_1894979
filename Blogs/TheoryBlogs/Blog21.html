              User experience (UX) revolves around the end user’s interactions
              and experience with a product. As such, in web design it is
              extremely important to understand the way the end user interacts
              with your site, to design a good UX. However, this understanding
              of the user’s interaction can also be used for malicious intent,
              through dark UX patterns. In this blog post I then delve further
              into dark UX, first looking at what it is and its origins, before
              then going over the different types and the impact they have.
            </p>

            <p>
              To start, it is important that we understand what dark UX patterns
              are, and the history behind them. The term dark UX pattern was
              first coined by Harry Brignull in 2010, where he defines it as “a
              user interface carefully crafted to trick users into doing things
              they might not otherwise do” (Brignull, 2013). While Brignull uses
              this definition to refer to digital dark UX patterns, it is
              important to understand that the use of dark UX patterns predates
              the internet, with examples of this seen in museums that require
              you exit through the gift store. Although, Brignull also notes
              that there is a difference between dark UX and bad UX – where UX
              is not considered at all, and thus there is no malicious intent.
            </p>

            <p>
              With dark UX patterns now defined, we can then start to look at
              the different types of dark UX patterns. Brignull outlines 12
              different types of dark patterns: trick questions, sneak into
              basket, roach motel, privacy suckering, price comparison
              prevention, misdirection, hidden costs, bait and switch, confirm
              shaming, disguised ads, force continuity, and friend spam.
              However, for the sake of this blog post I will just be looking at
              the three most common types – starting with trick questions.
            </p>

            <p>
              Brignull defines trick questions as when you are filling out a
              form and “you respond to a question, which, when glanced upon
              quickly appears to ask one thing, but if read carefully, asks
              another thing entirely” (Birgnull, N/A). Common ways this is done
              is when a platform subverts the meaning of a check box, where
              ticking it means no. Examples of this can be seen below, where the
              user must opt out of communication via a checkbox.
            </p>

                title="An example of trick question dark UX Pattern"
              />

            <p>
              Next there is forced continuity. On the internet, many services
              are paid. As a result, users often sign up for free trials, most
              of which require a credit card. Forced continuity then comes into
              play when this service continues to charge your credit card every
              month, without warning – ultimately abusing the lack of rules
              around this.
            </p>

            <p>
              The last major dark pattern type I will speak about is
              misdirection. This occurs when a user’s focus is directed to one
              place, in order to draw attention away from another space. An
              example of this can be seen on sites where content appears to be
              locked behind a paywall, while upon further investigation the
              content is just present elsewhere on the page.
            </p>

            <p>
              Ultimately, by looking at just two examples of dark UX patterns,
              we can see how powerful UX design is. More specifically, we can
              see how UX design can be used maliciously to lead users to
              performing various actions which they never intended, all without
              their knowledge. As such, it is important that designers have an
              understanding of these design patterns so that they can avoid
              them, and actively design a better user experiences.
