            <p>
              User interface (UI), and user experience (UX), design are
              extremely important when developing a website, yet so often they
              are merely just an afterthought. This is problematic, as bad UI
              and UX instantly result in a bad site – no matter how good the
              content is. As such, in this blog post I critically analyse both
              my websites UI and UX. More specifically, I will start by defining
              each term, before moving on to look at the UI and UX I have
              implemented, critically reflecting on my decisions.
            </p>

            <p>
              Firstly, we will start by looking at my website’s user experience.
              To do this, however, we must understand what UX is. UX is all
              about the functionality of the website, and the experience the
              user gets from using it – looking specifically at how users
              experience the site, and how easily they can perform the task they
              set out to achieve.
            </p>

            <p>
              With that, we can then start to analyse my websites UX. Throughout
              its creation, I made a point of keeping the user, and their needs,
              in mind. As a result, there were two questions that I asked
              myself: what are users trying to achieve when visiting the
              website, and is the process as easy as possible? Thus, I
              established two potential goals for users visiting my site –
              learning more about my fictional character, Jake Sky, and his
              photography; or looking for my blogs. When a user first lands on
              my website they are presented with the homepage, where I
              accommodate for these two user goals in three ways: presenting the
              user with an example of my fictional characters photography,
              giving quick access to the characters most recent portfolio piece,
              and lastly giving access to my three most recent blog posts. Using
              these, I make the users experience as fluid as possible. However,
              in the case that the user has other goals, a persistent navigation
              bar, with clearly labelled items, is present – allowing for easy
              navigate across the entire site.
            </p>

            <p>
              In addition to this, there is the website’s UI. In general, UI
              consists of the visual design of the website – encompassing its
              look, presentation, and interactivity. This can most easily be
              identified through a websites colour choice, buttons, fonts, and
              more.
            </p>

            <p>
              For my UI, I chose to mainly rely on a minimalistic design, and
              colour scheme, for multiple reasons. Firstly, it is imperative
              that the site portray Jakes personality, as he is a minimalist.
              Secondly, this minimalist design, and colour scheme, help to put a
              focus on the content of the website. This is important, as the
              main purpose of the site is to showcase Jakes photography. By
              using a clean user interface, and grayscale, both Jakes
              photography, and all other content across the site, are
              highlighted and accentuated. Lastly, it is important to note that
              this minimalist design was not done at the expense of usability.
              In fact, usability is at the core of the UI. Sitewide, users are
              given adequate indicators about the function of multiple elements
              – ranging from cards ‘lifting up’, buttons inverting their
              colours, and the navbar items changing shades when a user hovers
              over them to indicate they are interactable.
            </p>

            <p>
              In conclusion, by first defining UI and UX, I was able to
              critically analyse my sites design. However, with a longer blog
              post I could have gone into more depth, evaluating more UI/UX
              elements – such as consistency and imagery.
