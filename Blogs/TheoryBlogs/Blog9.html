        <p>
          In this blog post I will be looking at a chapter of Marshal McLuhan’s
          book Understanding Media (McLuhan, 2001), The Medium is the Message, and
          relating it to the internet. As this writing is quite complex to read,
          and difficult to interpret, I will start by giving a brief overview of
          the text before looking at how McLuhan’s text relates, and impacts, the
          web.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, it is important to look what he meant by the paradoxical saying
          The Medium is the Message. In this work, McLuhan explains that people
          focus too much on the content, the message, that they are receiving and
          not enough on the medium which the content is presented on. McLuhan even
          goes as far as to say that “the content of any medium blinds us to the
          character of the medium”, which reinforces the idea that the
          distinguishing features that a medium has hold more value than the
          content because it shapes the way in which the content is created and
          interpreted – the medium controls the message, and as such it then
          becomes the message. On top of this, McLuhan also states that the medium
          allows for new affordances and is an extension of oneself, and as such
          it ends up shaping the individual.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, the user navigates the browser and gives it a website domain name
          to look up. With this, the browser does a Domain Name System (DNS)
          Lookup in order to find the IP address of the provided domain name. Once
          found, the browser establishes a connection with the data server through
          a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) handshake. If the website is more
          secure, the browser will also have to perform an extra step of security
          and establish a Transport Layer Security (TLS) handshake using multiple
          encryption keys too.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, while McLuhan published this work in 1962, before the existence of
          the internet, he already had an important grasp over new media how they
          impacted communication. When we look at how his theories relate to the
          internet, we can start by looking at the way we share content on the
          internet. The internet encompasses many forms of communication, each
          having their own different affordances and ways of communicating, one of
          which are social medias. However, not only do social medias have their
          own limitations and affordances, but each specific social media has
          their own unique affordances and ways of communicating. If a user posts
          something on TikTok their audience assumes it will be short and concise
          as this is the way the social media has chosen to limit their users.
          However, if content is posted on YouTube, a user knows to expect longer
          content. Each social media – medium – thus shapes the content we share
          on it. This ultimately falls in line with McLuhan’s theory that the
          medium shapes the content that is created and as such it shapes what
          individuals expect from different mediums.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, this results in a direct impact on the way we develop for
          the web. With the Web 1.0, the internet was very static and while it was
          a medium that allowed users to view information, it tended to be more
          official. With the introduction of the Web 2.0, users were then able to
          post their own content and as such, new mediums on the internet were
          created to accommodate this. Developers now have to keep in mind the
          impact that their website will have and how it will shape the way people
          interactive with one another, and their site.
        </p>
        <p>
          In conclusion, although Marshal McLuhan wrote this text before the
          invention of the internet, he had a firm understanding of the way in
          which mass communication and different mediums affected the content they
          were portraying. This relates directly to the internet, ultimately
          playing a role in how websites should be developed.
