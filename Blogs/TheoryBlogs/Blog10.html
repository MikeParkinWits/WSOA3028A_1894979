              The Oxford English Dictionary defines the word semantic as
              “relating to meaning in language or logic” (“Semantic,” n.d.), but
              how exactly does this relate to web design? In this blog post, I
              will look at the importance of using semantics, in the form of
              semantic markup, when writing HTML. To do this I start by defining
              what semantic markup is, with the aid of examples, before looking
              at why one should even use semantic markup when writing HTML.
            </p>

            <p>
              First, we can look at what semantic markup is. To use words
              semantically means to use it in the correct way that relates to
              its meaning. When writing HTML, there are a number of different
              tags with different semantic meanings. By extension, semantic
              markup is then the process of using HTML tags in the way that they
              were intended to be used, giving meaning to what you write (see
              figure 1 below). For example, using &lt;h1&gt; tags for headers,
              or &lt;p&gt; tags for paragraph would be good semantic markup.
              However, while it is possible to use a &lt;h1&gt; tag for
              paragraphs, and a &lt;p&gt; tag for headers, this would not be
              semantic as that is not their intended purpose nor meaning. On top
              of this, certain HTML tags, such as &lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt;,
              do not contain any meaning and therefore cannot be used
              semantically at all.
            </p>

                width="450"
                height="212"
                title="An example of good semantic markup"
              />

            <p>
              But why is semantic markup important, and what are the benefits of
              using it correct? There are actually two distinct benefits of
              using semantic markup. First, by using semantic markup you will
              produce better code that is clearer and more concise. This can
              help you with understand your code better in the event that you
              need to go back and review old code. Secondly, and most
              importantly, semantic markup can help your code be more accessible
              to people with disabilities (using screen readers) and web robots.
              This is because both screen readers and web robots rely on
              semantics to relay information about websites.
            </p>

            <p>
              In conclusion, by defining semantic markup, I was able to give two
              important benefits of using correct semantic markup when writing
              HTML.
