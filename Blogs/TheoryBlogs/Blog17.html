            <p>
              In today’s day and age, access to Information and Communication
              Technologies (ICTs) is crucial however, access to ICTs is not
              always available to everyone – this results in a digital divide.
              In this blog post I discuss this digital divide in the context of
              South Africa, looking specifically at the reasoning behind it and
              how this divide can be bridged.
            </p>

            <p>
              First, it is important to understand what the digital divide is,
              and the reasons behind it both globally and in South Africa. As
              stated in the introduction, a digital divide occurs when there is
              an unequal access to ICTs. According to a research survey done in
              2013 (Zickuhr & Smith, 2013), there are five factors globally that
              result in the global divide: a lack of access to ICTs, the cost
              associated with accessing these ICTs, a lower education level, a
              lower technical and digital literacy, and lastly a lack of actual
              interest in going digital. While these factors play a huge role in
              the reasoning behind the digital divide in South Africa, they have
              ultimately stemmed from Apartheid era inequality which continues
              to have a lasting effect on all aspects of inequality in South
              Africa. This is extremely worrying as more and more aspects of our
              lives become digital, especially in the wake of the global
              pandemic, people continue to be left behind – in turn increasing
              the digital divide.
            </p>

            <p>
              As a result, it is crucial that we work quickly to try and counter
              act this divide and the lasting effects of previous inequalities.
              To achieve this, there are two main areas of focus. First, it is
              important that there is funding and investment in these areas to
              help create access to ICTs in areas that need it the most –
              whether through free internet hotspots or free beginner computer
              courses. Secondly, it is important that higher education produces
              graduates that are extremely technically and digitally able. This
              increase in technically able people would in turn allow for
              greater technical competency in all aspects of the country.
            </p>

            <p>
              In conclusion, the digital divide is a huge problem for not only
              the world, but specifically South Africa, as the divide stems from
              Apartheid-era inequalities. However, not all hope is lost as with
              a focus on investment in digital infrastructure and digital
              competency at higher education levels, we can see a future where
              these is a much smaller digital divide.
