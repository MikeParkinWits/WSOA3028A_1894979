            <p>
              In the modern day, almost everyone has a story about how their
              device must be listening in on their conversations. But why is
              this, and should users then be worried about their privacy? In
              this blog post I explore this concern, why it happens, and whether
              users should be worried about their privacy.
            </p>

            <p>
              To start, we must look at what the concern is. Most people have
              heard numerous stories from both friends, and family, about how
              they met up with a friend and discussed something, and soon after
              that the very thing they were discussing appears on their phone as
              an advert – whether it be a holiday location, clothing item, or a
              restaurant. This often leaves people with a sour taste in their
              mouth, as they believe their privacy has been breached. To make
              things worse, there have been multiple reports of big tech
              companies, such as Facebook and Amazon, listening in on saved
              conversations. This has led to a slew of creative options for
              protecting one’s privacy, such as covering microphones and webcams
              with tape. But is there truly a need for this, or is it nothing
              more than just an unnecessary precaution?
            </p>

            <p>
              The simple answer is that these big companies don’t actually need
              access to your microphone, or camera, to serve you these ads. In
              2018, the world learnt of the data analysis company Cambridge
              Analytica, which had been collecting and analyzing data from
              millions of Facebook users all around the world. While this
              company has since gone bankrupt, it gave users an insight into
              just how much data they give up online. In fact, it was found that
              big companies have almost 5 000 data points on every person in the
              United States alone, all from information that users have shared
              freely online.
            </p>

            <p>
              But how do you get adverts for items you never searched but merely
              discussed then? Robert Reeve, a privacy tech worker, explains
              this. He says that these data points are everywhere, not just in
              what you search but in anything that can be linked to you in some
              way online – ranging from rewards programs with your email, which
              track your buying habits; or even your proximity to your friends,
              which allows for their search habits to be cross referenced with
              yours. As such, all this data is both more openly available, and
              easier to analyse, when compared to any data that could come from
              your microphone.
            </p>

            <p>
              But what does this mean for a user’s privacy? While I still
              believe that users should be concerned about their privacy, they
              must direct this concern towards the data they are willingly
              giving away by accepting cookies, and privacy policies, without
              understanding them. Luckily, however, this has been changing in
              recent years – with companies such as Google and Apple adopting an
              opt-in approach to sharing data, as opposed to opting out.
            </p>

            <p>
              In conclusion, I looked at why users believe their device is
              listening to them, and how this is not true. Instead, I showed
              that big companies do not need to do this, as they collect
              thousands of data points to target ads towards you. However, I
              concluded by noting that while users must still be cautious of the
              information they share, big tech companies are starting to change
              this and put user’s privacy at the forefront.
