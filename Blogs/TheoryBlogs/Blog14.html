            <p>
              The distribution of information geographically has long been
              augmented, with the Global North being the main producer of
              information over the Global South. However, with the dawn of the
              internet many believed that this new access to information would
              shift this geography of information. In particular, journal
              articles such as “Towards a study of information geographies” – by
              Mark Graham, Stefano De Sabbata, and Matthew Zook (2015) – use
              different metrics of information to evaluate whether the internet
              age has created equal geographies of information in the 21st
              century. As such, in this blog post I look more closely at this
              journal article by first summarising the article through the same
              three categories of geographic distribution that the article uses:
              geographies of access, participation, and representation. I then
              conclude by reflecting critically on these points – giving my own
              opinions on the article as a whole.
            </p>

            <p>
              The first category they look at is geographies of access and
              enablement – an exploration into who has access to technology, and
              peoples participation and representation in a digitally connected
              space. Here they show that most of the internet population, the
              number of people in a country who have internet access, reside in
              Asia and North America. More so, it can be seen that while
              countries in the Global North have quite large internet
              populations and penetration, the Global South (Africa in
              particular) hardly has any internet penetration. This can be
              accounted to what they label as one of the core themes of the
              global digital divide – broadband cost. While North America may
              seemingly have high broadband costs, relative to the countries
              average income they are extremely low. In contrast to this,
              broadband costs in African countries tend to be extremely high
              relative to their average income, with one of the worst being
              Eritrea’s yearly broadband cost which equates to 50 years of
              average income. This shows how there is ultimately an uneven
              access of information between the Global North and Global South
              because of relative broadband costs.
            </p>

              With those differences now in mind, we can then start to look at
              why websites need both a good UI and UX. From the above we can see
              that UI and UX serve two different purposes, however if a website
              only accommodates one, or the other, it would result in bad web
              design. This is because both the way a user interacts with a
              website, and what that website looks like, play a part in keeping
              a good userbase. If a website had an extremely beautiful design
              that distracted users from performing basic tasks, then users
              would become frustrated and not want to use the site again. On the
              other end, if a website is overly functional, and contains no
              visuals, then the user will not actually enjoy using the website.
              As a result, UI and UX designers have to work together to create a
              balance of the two in order to please their users in the hopes of
              creating a consistent userbase.
            </p>

            <p>
              Thereafter, the authors discuss geographies of participation,
              which looks at where digital information is generated. To do this
              they focus on three areas: domain names, GitHub users, and
              Wikipedia edits. Across these different categories of
              participation, the authors noted some interesting trends. Firstly,
              they found that 93% of all domain address registered on the
              internet come from Global North, with only 2% of the remaining 7%
              being registered in Africa and the Middle East. Secondly, when
              looking at the distribution of collaborative coding on GitHub they
              found that North America and Europe both over produced relative to
              the userbase of GitHub in that country. Thirdly, they found that
              while Wikipedia does allow anyone to edit and contribute, there is
              a problem with who provides the information about different
              countries – with less than 5% of all content posted about Africa
              actually being locally contributed to. All of this highlights the
              difference in informational geography and participation between
              the Global North and Global South, with a particular emphasis on
              the lack of participation from the African continent. This in turn
              shows the inherent bias of information because of this skew in
              contributions, resulting in information becoming questionable.
            </p>

            <p>
              Next, there is the category of geographies of representation –
              which is all about who content is created for and who it is
              created by. To analyse this, they look at various different
              digital representations in order to understand spatial differences
              – starting with Google Searches. By using Google to search every
              countries name in various languages, it can be seen that there is
              definitely a skew in the mentions of countries compared to their
              internet population. This can clearly be seen through the sheer
              number of mentions of the United States, Japan, China, and the
              United Kingdom compared to their internet population. Thereafter,
              they looked at OpenStreetMap, which is a freely editable map. Here
              they found that North America, in combination with four other
              European countries, accounted for over 58% of all the content on
              the platform. Lastly, they looked at two important databases to
              the semantic web – Freebase and Geonames. While both are looked at
              independently in the journal article, we are able to combine the
              outcomes from both as they show very similar results. Both
              Freebase and Geonames show North America and Europe having
              proportionally large representation when compared to other
              countries. All of this again ultimately shows the power of, and
              skew of information from, the Global North – with a particular
              amount of power given to North America and Europe, and a lack of
              power in Africa.
            </p>

            <p>
              Now, with this journal article summarised I can start to reflect
              on it as a whole. From this article, it can be seen that there is
              indeed still a discrepancy in the geography of information between
              the Global North and South, and while it was believed that
              technologies such as the web would help close this gap, this
              ultimately proved to be too idealistic. In fact, it is extremely
              easy to see the effect of this in our daily life. When accessing
              any social media or news site in South Africa, you would be
              surprised to see that it is inundated with American and European
              information, with local content and information mostly taking
              second stage. Not only is this problematic from the perspective of
              the information we consume, but it is also problematic as it makes
              it harder for local content to be shared – ultimately shaping the
              Global North as more powerful in the digital space.
            </p>

            <p>
              However, while I do agree with the outcome of the journal article,
              I believe it is fundamentally flawed in some aspects. This is
              because the journal article was written from the perspective of
              the western Global North, and as such has its own geographic
              information bias – with both Graham and De Sabbata from the United
              Kingdom, and Zook from the United States. The biggest problem that
              stems from this is that the journal article ignores any region
              specific services and only focuses on what the western Global
              North has deemed as widely acceptable. An example of this can be
              seen when looking at China, as they have a huge internet
              population but in every other category and section they pale in
              comparison to the rest of the Global North in representation. This
              is most likely due to China having their own Intranet, and suite
              of applications, that most of their population is accessing. So
              while I do understand that this journal article is only giving a
              preliminary look at data, it failes to address information like
              this, and potential other exclusions and oversights because of the
              specific dataset used. This can result in people ignoring the
              actual outcome of the paper, which I mostly agree with, and
              viewing it purely as another paper written only from the
              perspective of the Global North.
