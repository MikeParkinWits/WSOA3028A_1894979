              When people hear the term web robots, they may think of physical
              robots that access the web, but this is not the case. Instead, web
              robots are just pieces of software that traverse the web,
              performing various tasks such as automation and data indexing. In
              this blog post I look at web robot’s origin and functions, the
              different forms they come in, and their importance on the web.
            </p>

            <p>
              First, we can look at a brief history of web robots/internet bots.
              The idea of web robots is not new with their origin being traced
              back as far as the inception of the world wide web in the late
              1980’s. Originally, these bots were used for automation purposes,
              however, since then different types of bots have been developed
              and used in other places around the web. In fact, just over half
              of all web traffic today is generated by bots.
            </p>

            <p>
              Furthermore, we can look at the different types of bots used on
              the web. First, there are spider web robots which are used by
              search engines to search and index the web. These allow search
              engines to provide the user with more accurate search results.
              Next, there are trading web robots that are used to traverse the
              web and find the best deals across multiple e-commerce websites.
              Then there are media web robots, which are used to find the most
              recent news, weather, and various other forms of media.
            </p>

            <p>
              However, as with the internet as a whole, not all web robots are
              good. Here we will look at the four main types of malicious web
              robots on the web today. First there are spam web robots, which
              mainly collect data from the web to spread advertisements to
              users. Next there are hacker web robots, which attempt to find
              vulnerabilities across the web that can be exploited. Third, there
              are botnets, which are networks that hackers use to perform
              various malicious acts such as denial of service attacks. Lastly,
              there are download web robots that forcibly redirect users to
              malicious websites instead of the website the user intends to
              visit.
            </p>

            <p>
              In conclusion, although web robots have been used for a malicious
              intent, ultimately, I believe that the positive impact that they
              play outweighs their potential negatives. In fact, web robots have
              served an important role in shaping the internet, and still
              continue to do so today. Without them, search engines such as
              Google and Bing would not be nearly as useful nor powerful and as
              a result, the internet has become an extremely easy to use, and
              valuable, tool in our everyday lives.
