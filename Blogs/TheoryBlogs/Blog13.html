          While many people still use User Interface (UI) and User Experience
          (UX) interchangeably, they actually refer to two different things.
          This occurs because both are closely linked, not only in the field of
          web design, but also in the design of everyday things. As such, in
          this essay I define the differences between UI and UX, evaluate the
          importance of having a good balance of both when designing websites,
          and conclude by offering some design tips to achieve this balance.
        </p>

        <p>
          Firstly, it is important to establish the difference between a
          websites UI and UX. Put simply, the UI is the look, presentation and
          interactivity of a website. This is most obvious is in the visual
          design of a website, which can range from button designs, to fonts and
          colours, and more. The UX, however, is about the experience of using
          the website – how well does the website serve the purpose that the
          user expects from it. An example of this would be the ease of use of
          an e-commerce website. If a user is trying to buy something, it would
          frustrate them if they had to click 30 buttons in order to checkout,
          as opposed to clicking just 2.
        </p>

        <p>
          With those differences now in mind, we can then start to look at why
          websites need both a good UI and UX. From the above we can see that UI
          and UX serve two different purposes, however if a website only
          accommodates one, or the other, it would result in bad web design.
          This is because both the way a user interacts with a website, and what
          that website looks like, play a part in keeping a good userbase. If a
          website had an extremely beautiful design that distracted users from
          performing basic tasks, then users would become frustrated and not
          want to use the site again. On the other end, if a website is overly
          functional, and contains no visuals, then the user will not actually
          enjoy using the website. As a result, UI and UX designers have to work
          together to create a balance of the two in order to please their users
          in the hopes of creating a consistent userbase.
        </p>

        <p>
          Lastly, we can look at four basic ways the designers can achieve a
          good UI/UX balance. First, designers should choose a font that
          accurately portrays the websites personality. Secondly, contrast
          should be used to both make the design more appealing and make things
          stand out. Next, designers can create more engagement by adding
          shortcuts to their site to allow for easier navigation and layout.
          Finally, designers can add space between items on a page in order to
          make items easier to read and more visually appealing.
        </p>

        <p>
          In conclusion, although UI and UX are often used synonymously, in this
          blog post I was able to differentiate the two. I then used this
          differentiation in order to highlight the importance of the UI and UX
          designer working together to create a good balance of both in a
          website, concluding by giving four basic ways that designers can go
          about achieving this UI/UX balance.
