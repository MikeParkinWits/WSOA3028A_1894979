              While many people still use User Interface (UI) and User
              Experience (UX) interchangeably, they actually refer to two
              different things. This occurs because both are closely linked, not
              only in the field of web design, but also in the design of
              everyday things. As such, in this essay I define the differences
              between UI and UX, evaluate the importance of having a good
              balance of both when designing websites, and conclude by offering
              some design tips to achieve this balance.
            </p>

            <p>
              Firstly, it is important to establish the difference between a
              websites UI and UX. Put simply, the UI is the look, presentation
              and interactivity of a website. This is most obvious is in the
              visual design of a website, which can range from button designs,
              to fonts and colours, and more. The UX, however, is about the
              experience of using the website â€“ how well does the website serve
              the purpose that the user expects from it. An example of this
              would be the ease of use of an e-commerce website. If a user is
              trying to buy something, it would frustrate them if they had to
              click 30 buttons in order to checkout, as opposed to clicking just
              2.
            </p>

            <p>
              With those differences now in mind, we can then start to look at
              why websites need both a good UI and UX. From the above we can see
              that UI and UX serve two different purposes, however if a website
              only accommodates one, or the other, it would result in bad web
              design. This is because both the way a user interacts with a
              website, and what that website looks like, play a part in keeping
              a good userbase. If a website had an extremely beautiful design
              that distracted users from performing basic tasks, then users
              would become frustrated and not want to use the site again. On the
              other end, if a website is overly functional, and contains no
              visuals, then the user will not actually enjoy using the website.
              As a result, UI and UX designers have to work together to create a
              balance of the two in order to please their users in the hopes of
              creating a consistent userbase.
            </p>

            <p>
              Lastly, we can look at four basic ways the designers can achieve a
              good UI/UX balance. First, designers should choose a font that
              accurately portrays the websites personality. Secondly, contrast
              should be used to both make the design more appealing and make
              things stand out. Next, designers can create more engagement by
              adding shortcuts to their site to allow for easier navigation and
              layout. Finally, designers can add space between items on a page
              in order to make items easier to read and more visually appealing.
            </p>

            <p>
              In conclusion, although UI and UX are often used synonymously, in
              this blog post I was able to differentiate the two. I then used
              this differentiation in order to highlight the importance of the
              UI and UX designer working together to create a good balance of
              both in a website, concluding by giving four basic ways that
              designers can go about achieving this UI/UX balance.
