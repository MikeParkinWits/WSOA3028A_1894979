            <p>
              Social media has been around for most of the internet era, and
              like the internet, it has changed drastically over the past few
              decades. Originally, social media was used to connect with friends
              and family but, through the use of algorithms, it now acts as a
              space where users explore relevant information curated just for
              them. This, in turn, sparked questions around the algorithm’s used
              by social media – such as a Twitter thread by Marc Faddoul,
              questioning the ethical nature of TikTok’s algorithm. As such, in
              this blog post I look at the issues raised in this Twitter thread,
              evaluating the use of algorithms in social media, and the problems
              that arise from them.
            </p>

            <p>
              As stated in the introduction, the purpose of social media has
              shifted over the years. This shift was part of a move from
              organically curated content, where users only see content linearly
              from accounts they follow, to algorithmically curated content,
              which revolves around keeping users on the platform by serving
              them more relevant content. While each social media platform is
              different, with their own unique algorithms, the reason behind
              this change revolved around accommodating spam and the growing
              amount of content, allowing for a more pleasant user experience.
            </p>

            <p>
              However, these algorithms brought a handful of problems. As seen
              in the screenshot below, Marc Faddoul identifies a clear bias in
              TikTok’s algorithm. He states that when a user tries to follow
              someone on TikTok, the platform automatically recommends other
              users with similar appearances – not only in ethnicity and/or
              gender, but also in hair colour, visible disabilities, body
              proportions, and more.
            </p>

                src="../../Images/Blog24_Image.png"

                width="462"
                height="122"
                title="Screenshot showing a twwet that highlights TikTok algorithm bias"
              />

            </figure>

            <p>
              This creates the assumption that TikTok purposefully built an
              algorithm to group users based on physical appearance, as opposed
              to content. However, through further research this is quickly
              debunked, as multiple users have confirmed TikTok’s claims that
              they use collaborative filtering – an algorithm that recommends
              users to follow based on other user’s follower habits. But why do
              recommended users all have similar appearances? This falls into
              the realm of human bias, showing that users have an inherent bias
              by following people with certain appearances. The algorithm then
              carries these biases forward, ultimately leading to the algorithm
              having an appearance bias of its own.
            </p>

            <p>
              Although, the biggest ethical concerns revolve around the feedback
              loop that this algorithm creates. If users are only ever
              recommended similair users to follow, their bias is further
              reinforced, creating a perpetual loop wherein all users are served
              the same, bias, content. If most users also have this bias, then
              the platform ultimately favours this – discouraging any diversity.
              Unfortunately, this behaviour is not unique to TikTok, and can be
              seen in most social media platforms. As a result, any inherent
              human bias that exists can be perpetuated by the very algorithms
              that have been created to try and alleviate them. This is a
              problem, as developers believe that they are creating an unbiased
              algorithm, when in fact they are doing the opposite. Therefore, it
              is imperative that developers understand the consequences of what
              they create, so that they can create around these ethical issues.
            </p>

            <p>
              In conclusion, by using TikTok as an example, I looked at the
              algorithms that are present in social media. I then evaluated how
              these algorithms create an inherent bias on various social media
              platforms, raising ethical concerns around the use of algorithms
              in social media. On top of this, I also discussed why developers
              should take this human bias into account, and design around them.
