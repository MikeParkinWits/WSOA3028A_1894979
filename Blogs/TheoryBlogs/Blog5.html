            <p>
              The burst of the dot-com bubble resulted in the loss of trillions
              of dollars, but the affect and impact it had on the internet was
              huge, laying the groundwork for the future. In this blog post I
              discuss this by breaking down the internet and World Wide Web
              before, during, and after the dot-com bubble burst.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although the World Wide Web was established by Tim Berners-Lee
              between the late 1980’s and early 1990’s, it was still not easily
              accessible to many people as it required both expensive hardware
              and a vast technical knowledge. However, this all changed when the
              more user focused browsers, Mosaic and Netscape Navigator,
              launched in 1993 and 1994 respectively. Along with their more
              user-friendly design, they allowed the internet to be more
              accessible to the average person as they were available on more
              platforms. This led to an exponential increase in both internet
              users and overall web traffic.
            </p>
            <p>
              This created a shift in entrepreneurs who now saw potential on the
              internet and creating dot-com companies (companies created around
              website ideas). This exponential growth of the internet blindsided
              investors and they quickly invested more money into these
              companies – being told more money invested now would result in
              higher profits later. This resulted in the “stock equity
              valuations” of technology and the internet to grow and led to many
              dot-com companies IPOs (Initial Public Offerings) gaining
              exponential growth and unheard-of valuations.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, the majority of these companies were reporting a loss,
              focusing their efforts and investors’ money on growth – as
              investors only caried about this, along with the websites userbase
              and valuations. But in the early 2000’s things quickly changed
              when the Japanese economy went into a recession. This acted as a
              catalyst for the dot-com bubble bursting as investors quickly
              became more cautious with their money and the dot-com company’s
              high valuations started to fall. While bigger investors were not
              badly affected, it was the average investor that was impacted the
              most – losing trillions of dollars.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nonetheless, the bursting of the dot-com bubble had its positives.
              First, this proved as a valuable lesson for both future companies
              and investors to take profit into account and not only valuation
              and growth. Secondly, this quick expansion of the internet meant
              that the infrastructure for the internet needed to expand. This
              resulted in an important infrastructure of fiber optics being laid
              down. On top of this, with most of the dot-com companies becoming
              bankrupt, a large amount of bandwidth on this infrastructure
              became unused. This paved the way for future companies to come in
              and expand both easily and cheaply.
            </p>
            <p>
              So although the bursting of the dot-com bubble resulted in
              trillions of dollars being lost, it was an important milestone in
              the development of the internet as it taught both tech companies
              to seek more than just valuation and growth, and it helped lay the
              foundation for the future of the internet. Although, as much as it
              may have taught a lesson, many now argue that we are currently
              facing a repeat of what happened during the dot-com bubble in the
              form of the app bubble and a crypto bubble.
