          <section class="e-content standard-page-content">
            <p>
              First, in order to understand how a browser works we need to
              understand what it is. When looking at the definition of a
              browser, the Oxford English Dictionary defines it as “A computer
              program with a graphical user interface for displaying and
              navigating between web pages”. However, I do not agree with this
              definition for two reasons: it is too simplistic; and a browser
              does not require a graphical user. As such, I would rather define
              a web browser as a piece of software that allows a user to access
              information and view information that is store on the world wide
              web. This definition is broader, allowing it to still encompasses
              both graphical browsers, such as Google Chrome, while still
              including text-based browsers such as Lynx. On top of that, this
              does not limit a browser to just navigating between webpages,
              which is important as one can consider mobile applications a form
              of browser as they receive information from the world wide web and
              display it to the user, not displaying a webpage.
            </p>
            <p>
              Next, we can look at how a browser functions. Although a browser
              may seem like a basic piece of software, it has an important job
              and has to do a lot of processing in the background. To understand
              this processes, it is important to break it up into three
              sections: navigation, response, and rendering.
            </p>
            <p>
              First, the user navigates the browser and gives it a website
              domain name to look up. With this, the browser does a Domain Name
              System (DNS) Lookup in order to find the IP address of the
              provided domain name. Once found, the browser establishes a
              connection with the data server through a Transmission Control
              Protocol (TCP) handshake. If the website is more secure, the
              browser will also have to perform an extra step of security and
              establish a Transport Layer Security (TLS) handshake using
              multiple encryption keys too.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once this connection has been established, the process then moves
              to the response phase. The browser now sends the IP address it
              found to the server, which allows the server to look for the
              correct site. Once found, instead of sending back the entire
              website to the browser, the server sends the HTML file as this is
              much quicker and more efficient.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thereafter, the browser moves into the most crucial part of the
              process – rendering. With the HTML file received, the browser now
              parses the file and creates a Document Object Model (DOM) tree – a
              parsed version of the HTML file that contains a hierarchical list
              of meta data, and data to be displayed to the end user along with.
              With this done, the browser then focuses on the layout of the
              website. With all the content of the website parsed, the browser
              has to decided where this content should go and how it should be
              lay out on the page using either CSS and/or JavaScript. Lastly,
              the browser focuses on painting the webpage. Here, again using
              either CSS and/or JavaScript, the browser attempts to add all the
              visuals of the website, including elements such as colours,
              borders, and shadows.
            </p>
            <p>
              So, although the browser may seem simple, it is preforming a
              complex and important job in an extremely short amount of time. On
              top of all of this, once the browser has completed this entire
              process it then stores a copy of this website in its cache so that
              the next time the user accesses it, the browser can load it
              quicker and more easily.
            </p>
