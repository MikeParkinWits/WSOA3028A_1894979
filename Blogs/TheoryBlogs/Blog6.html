            <p>
              The web has changed drastically since its inception in the late
              1980’s, and I would argue that one of its most important changes
              was the shift from the Web 1.0 to Web 2.0. Here I discuss this
              shift, its importance, and then briefly look forward into the
              future of the web and the shift to the Web 3.0.
            </p>
            <p>
              From the world wide web’s inception, and through the entirety of
              the 1990’s, the web was on version 1.0. Although this was
              revolutionary at the time, and offered great innovation, it left a
              lot to be desired for most users. The Web 1.0 consisted mainly of
              server-side information, and as such the webpages were all static.
              This meant that users were able to access webpages to gain
              information, but were unable to add onto the web and create their
              own content.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, this changed in the 2000’s when the Web 2.0 was
              introduced. This signalled a shift from static read-only websites,
              to more interactive read and write websites. With a bigger
              emphasis on dynamic client-side webpages, not only where users
              able to gain information from the internet but they were now able
              to create their own form of content too. This signalled the age of
              the User-Generated content. Users were now doing everything from
              leaving reviews for products on e-commerce websites, to creating
              personal blogs. The paved the way for the social media sites such
              as Facebook and Twitter; and crowd-contribution sites like
              Wikipedia. This version of the web was now built around the users
              and their needs, giving people a voice on the internet.
            </p>
            <p>
              Even though the Web 2.0 helped pave the way for a more user
              focused internet, it was not all positive. Along with this, the
              Web 2.0 helped boost a more centralised web where this
              user-generated content started to become monetised. Big
              centralised companies such as Google, Facebook, and Amazon were
              now trying to build an audience in order to collect data. Once
              enough data was collected this data would be sold to create target
              advertising – which was never a concern with the Web 1.0.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, thankfully this is currently changing. Currently we are
              moving into the Web 3.0, which is a version of the Web that is
              safer and more inclusive as it signals a shift to a more
              decentralized web. This is brought on through the use of
              blockchain and allows users to have control over their own data,
              instead of big centralised companies. But this shift has proven to
              take time, and as a result some say we are currently in the
              transitionary stage of the Web 2.5 - a combination of both the Web
              2.0 and Web 3.0
            </p>
            <p>
              In conclusion, the Web 2.0 was influential not only because of its
              technological evolution, but because of its shift to a more
              user-generated web. However, this version of the web created
              problems in terms of centralization and user privacy. Luckily
              though, we are currently in slow a transition period to a new
              version of the web that is meant to be decentralised and will
              allow users to take control of their data instead.
