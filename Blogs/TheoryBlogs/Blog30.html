              During the beginning of the internet era, it was easy for developers to
              design webpages that would look good on a user’s computer screen –
              as there was a limited number of devices that users could used to access
              the internet, all with a set of predefined screen sizes. However, as
              technology advanced, so did the devices that could access the
              internet – resulting in a slew of different sized screens. As
              such, developers could no longer create websites tailor to
              specific device screen sizes. In this blog post I will look at the
              most popular solution to this problem, responsive design. To do
              this, I will go over how responsive design came to be, what it is,
              and conclude with why every modern-day website should use it.
            </p>

            <p>
              First, before we can look at what responsive design is, we must
              understand the problem it tries to solve. In the beginning of the
              internet era, the computer was the only way to access the
              internet, and as it had not yet become a common household object,
              there was little variation in its hardware. This made designing
              websites extremely easy for developers, as they only had to design
              their website to work on a handful of different screen sizes –
              allowing developers to hardcode their websites design, making them
              pixel perfect. However, as computers started to evolve and become
              more popular, with the number of internet users growing
              simultaneously, these pixel perfect designs started to become
              unfeasible – as new technology with varying screen sizes was
              introduced, which broke the hardcoded websites. As a result,
              primitive methods for dynamically adjusting content to fit
              different screen sizes was employed – such as liquid layouts.
            </p>

            <p>
              While these methods proved to be effective for a range of
              different desktop screen sizes, with the introduction of
              smartphones, with much smaller screen sizes, they no longer
              worked. As such, developers tried to counter this by building
              mobile specific subdomains that loaded a mobile version of a
              website on a mobile device, while still loading the full desktop
              version when accessed on a computer. However, this meant that
              developers had to maintain two separate versions of their site –
              which was time consuming and resulted in inconsistencies between
              the two different versions.
            </p>

            <p>
              As a result, this led to the creation of responsively designed
              websites, which are sites that automatically scale their content
              to match the screen size of the device it is viewed on – without
              the need for multiple different versions of your website. This
              approach to web design is therefore much easier to manage and
              design for when compared to creating multiple different versions
              of the site for different screen sizes. Not only that, but it
              provides various other benefits, such as: a more consistent user
              experience between devices; a more cost-effective development
              cost, as only one site is being built; and better search engine
              optimization, as Google prioritizes responsive websites that cater
              for mobile devices. As such, I believe that there is no reason why
              any modern-day website should be using older methods of web
              design, as the benefits of responsive design are unmatched.
            </p>

            <p>
              In conclusion, in this blog post I went over the importance of
              responsive web design, by first look at how it came to be.
              Thereafter, I then established the benefits of using responsive
              design and why every modern-day website should utilize it.
