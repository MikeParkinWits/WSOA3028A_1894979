              Metaphors have become so engrained in how we process information
              digitally that we have become unaware that they are even used. In
              this blog post I explore the use of metaphors in the digital
              space, looking at their origin and how we still use and interact
              with them today – using examples throughout to demonstrate this.
            </p>

            <p>
              At the beginning of the digital age, when technology was becoming
              more common place, most consumers were skeptical about using it as
              it appeared as too complicated. Engineers and software developers
              then had to find ways to counter this in order to allow technology
              to expand beyond just the enthusiast realm. As such, the use of
              metaphors was employed to give people something to relate to in
              digital spaces. Early examples of this can be seen on the
              internet, where terms such as ‘cyberspace’ and ‘superhighway’ were
              coined to teach users about what the internet is, and how it
              functions.
            </p>

            <p>
              Although, terms like ‘cyberspace’ and ‘superhighway’ are rarely
              used in the modern day, as most users understand the idea of the
              internet now, which brings about the question: are metaphors even
              still used in digital spaces today? The answer to this is a
              resounding yes, with most people unaware that they interact with
              these metaphors daily as they have become so ubiquitous – the most
              obvious metaphors found in user interfaces. User interface and
              user experience designers use interaction metaphors – which are
              metaphors that communicate the result of interactions – to
              increase the overall user experience. By doing this the designer
              can easily: describe patterns, reducing confusion about how to
              perform sequential actions; communicate the purpose of an element,
              and how to interact with it; and lastly relate items to the real
              world in order to create easier association for the user.
            </p>

            <p>
              To illustrate we can look at ecommerce websites. Almost all these
              websites make use of various symbols and terms that are similar to
              physical commerce stores. Users will interact with ‘baskets’, or
              ‘shopping carts’, to store the items they want to purchase, and
              once they are done shopping they can then click a button to take
              them to the ‘checkout’ in order to pay. So, although users never
              actually place anything in a basket, nor physically proceed to the
              checkout, these metaphors help to create a real-world association
              that assists the user in understanding how to interact with the
              core of the website. However, this is just one example, with
              metaphors being used in every digital space – from design
              languages such as skeuomorphism, which is about creating interface
              objects which mimic their real-world counterpart, all the way to
              explaining complex topics such as net neutrality.
            </p>

            <p>
              In conclusion, I looked at how metaphors came to be used in
              digital spaces. On top of this, I look at interaction metaphors in
              the modern day, using the example of ecommerce websites and their
              ‘baskets’ and ‘checkout’ to illustrate this. However, I also note
              that metaphors span much further than this and touch all aspects
              of digital space.
