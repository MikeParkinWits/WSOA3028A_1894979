              Hi, I'm Jake Sky! Most of you probably don't know me, but that's
              alright because hopefully you will soon! I'm originally from
              Texas, although I currently live in sunny California! I am
              obsessed with all things photography and filmmaking, and I've been
              lucky enough to make my obsession my work! At the moment I'm a
              freelance photographer, and I'm using this website to showcase my
              skills and portfolio - so if you're looking for a photographer,
              why not get in touch?
            </p>

            <p>
              Oh I forgot, if you're wondering what I look like - that's me
              there on the left! I know I look scary, but if you ever see me in
              person, come say hi - but just know that I always have my camera
              with me, so you might get a spontaneous photoshoot. And if you
              want to keep in the loop about where I am and what I've been up
              to, why not give me a follow on one of my social medias? It's as
              easy as clicking the icons under my picture!
            </p>

            <p>
              Anyway, that's me for now - Stay Motivated, Stay Inspired, and
              Never Stop Creating.
            </p>

                I was hired to trial run their new Sony A7R IV mirrorless
                camera. This included showing off the capabilities of the
                camera, and pushing it to its limits. Spent 2 weeks going around
                Japan, taking photos for various different local shops.

                I was hired at Amazon to take photos of their in house products,
                as well as take media photos. These include promotional media,
                staff photos, advertisement photos, and more!
